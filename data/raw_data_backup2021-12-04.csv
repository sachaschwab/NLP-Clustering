China has banned the private use of cryptocurrencies, making all cryptocurrency-related business activities illegal. The recently passed $1 trillion US infrastructure bill brings tougher rules on crypto-trading taxes. Meantime, some developing nations are embracing crypto.El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender in September with the hope of bettering its economy and Zimbabwe is considering doing the same. The biggest companies in the world are already using blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrency, including Amazon, Cargill, CVS, IBM, Seagate, and Visa. CEOs including Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Jack Dorsey, and government officials such as Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and incoming New York Mayor Eric Adams, have all voiced support for cryptocurrency and its wider adoption.Meantime, North America has become the world's biggest victim of ransomware attacks - paying a hefty $131 million in cryptocurrency to criminals in just one year amid the rapid rise of cryptocurrency adoption, a new study by Chainalysis showed.Story continuesMost of the crypto-based attacks were associated with Russia-based cybercriminal groups, the study added.Clinton's concerns about crypto were ""spot-on,"" economic regulations expert John Reed Stark, who spent 11 years as the chief of the SEC's Office of Internet Enforcement, told Insider.""The investment in cryptocurrency goes against every basic rule of investor protection,"" Stark told Insider. ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies trade on platforms that don't have any of the safety mechanisms that traditional exchanges have.""Clinton also addressed the topic of cybersecurity during the panel in relation to foreign disinformation campaigns and cyberwarfare that continue to pose challenges to the US and other Western states.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 22, 2021, 1:14 AM"

Photo: Marvin Recinos/AFP via GettyBitcoin (BTC-USD) was down by more than 2.5% on Monday morning, trading at $57,622 (£42,840).The fall comes as the president of El Salvador announced plans to build a 'bitcoin city' in the country at a promotional Bitcoin event in the coastal town of Mizata late on Saturday.President Nayib Bukele said the city will be circular to mimic the shape of a large coin, and will be built at the base of Conchagua volcano in order to harness its geothermal energy to power bitcoin mining as well as supply energy to the city. The construction and infrastructure of the city will be financed partly by an issue of $1bn in sovereign bonds backed by the cryptocurrency, Bukele said. The city will have no property, income or capital gains taxes, with costs covered by a sales tax and money raised by the bond issues.Bukele estimated that the construction of the public infrastructure would cost around 300,000 bitcoins.The bonds will be issued in 2022 and the construction of the city will begin 60 days later, according to the government.Read more: FTSE rises as COVID returns to haunt Europe and oil hits eight-week lowSamson Mow, chief strategy officer of blockchain technology company Blockstream joined Bukele onstage at the promotional Bitcoin event.He said the bonds will be US dollar-denominated 10-year bonds, with half the funds converted to bitcoin and the other half used for infrastructure and bitcoin mining.In September, El Salvador became the first country in the world to introduce bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the US dollar.The government launched a digital wallet known as the Chivo wallet and offered $30 worth of bitcoin to people who downloaded it.More than 200 new cash machines were also installed across the country and businesses were compelled to accept the cryptocurrency as payment, wherever possible.Bitcoin's price on Monday. Chart: Yahoo Finance UKThe move was presented as a way to boost economic development and jobs, but sparked protests across the country where 32.7% of the population remain below the poverty line and only 58% have access to the internet, which is necessary for bitcoin transactions.After some initial teething problems when the bitcoin price dropped and the Chivo wallet crashed, Bukele had said that millions of Salvadoreans were using the app.Story continuesBetween September and October, Salvadoreans living abroad sent around $32m in remittances back home using the Chivo wallet, according to the country’s Central Reserve Bank chief. That represents about 2.5% of all the remittances sent in those months.In the US on Monday, asset manager Invesco announced its decision to halt plans to launch a Bitcoin Strategy exchange traded fund (ETF) just hours before the fund was due to list in New York.Invesco said regulatory constraints would make it too expensive for investors. Read more: CBI calls for regional economic clusters to level up UKOne issue was that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was only planning to allow ETFs with 100% exposure to bitcoin futures.

Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.31% higher, and Dow Jones futures were up 0.25%, indicating a positive start to trading later.

But Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was down 0.39%.Stocks have remained strong even though inflation has hit a 31-year high in the US and is rising sharply in other advanced economies, prompting central banks to consider cutting back their stimulus packages.On Friday, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said the US economy is in a ""very strong position."" He raised the possibility that the Fed may start reducing its asset purchases more quickly. Investors will closely watch the minutes from the central bank's November meeting, due for release Wednesday.Also in focus is President Joe Biden's pick for the next Fed chair, with the choice seen as between incumbent Jerome Powell and noted dove Fed Governor Lael Brainard.

That said, bitcoin is showing no signs of slowing down with mainstream adoption likely to gain further momentum in the year ahead.”Last month, Ethereum overtook the value of JPMorgan Chase for the first time and is currently the world’s 15th most valuable asset with a market cap of more than half a trillion dollars – $10bn more than JPMorgan’s.Story continuesData from global assets aggregator CompaniesMarketCap shows that Ethereum is also ahead of payments giants Matercard, PayPal and Visa.Read MoreEthereum price smashes record high amid metaverse and NFT buzzWhat’s going on with ethereum?

Based on technical indicators, Bitcoin’s downside is capped at $53k, which suggests buyers will remain active towards $60K resistance.As part of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, strong dollar amid reports of an Indian Crypto ban trading volumes continue to decline. Although some analysts expect volatility to increase as November draws to a close in the bitcoin and ether options marketsPrices could move sharply over the next few days due to rising volatility, which could discourage buyers from holding onto positions for an extended period of time.Whales deposit Bitcoins at exchanges. Curiously, the exchanges have continued to outflow money, which has resulted in the reserves remaining near their lowest levels since mid-2018.In a report somewhat contradictory, Glassnode said long-term holders may not be spending as much as they were and are therefore more likely to be adding to positions than exiting them.There are two confluences on the chart from a technical perspective: the first is the 38% Fibonacci retracement level, and the second is the trendline that dates back to March 2020 and serves as support.Once the level is successfully backtested as support, it is possible that the uptrend will resume. On the other hand, the 50-day MA (*$60.6K), as well as $60K, seem to be the main immediate resistance levels.Bears might still have some runway left due to the constant trading volume during this correction.

Ether, on the other hand, on Wednesday managed to bounce off of its own such trendline.The second-largest token sees good round-number technical support at $4,000, according to Mike McGlone, a commodities analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It seems to be a battle with the leveraged longs from higher levels getting flushed and the longer-term, more institutional bid below the market,” he said. McGlone sees Ether consolidating its bull run within the $4,000 to $5,000 range.Cryptocurrencies have sold off in recent days amid a number of concerns, including greater regulatory risks as well as many tokens having run up very quickly in a short period of time. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which measures the performance of a handful of the largest tokens, has lost 14% so far this month.News that India is preparing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies appears to be behind the latest leg of the selloff in Bitcoin on Wednesday on exchanges popular with Indian investors. Bitcoin was down almost 14% at one point on WazirX while little changed elsewhere.Some analysts are also citing waning risk appetite in the broader equities market, where profitless technology companies have suffered the brunt of the declines.“We see Bitcoin come off in valuation when we see a selloff in the more speculative parts of the equity market,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said by phone.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Bitcoin lost as much as 3.1% to trade at $55,908, while Ether fell 4.2% at one point to $4,168.The important thing is that both Ether and Bitcoin held their lows from last week, according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Those lows -- $55,500 on XBT and $4,000 on XET -- are the more important short-term support levels.”Although Bitcoin has seen a sharp pullback within its intermediate-term uptrend, it is showing signs of short-term downside exhaustion per a number of indicators, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, an independent research firm focused on technical analysis. Plus, its oversold conditions increase the probability that it’s put a low into place.“We expect Bitcoin to resume its intermediate-term uptrend, allowing it to ultimately break out above resistance near $65K for a long-term measured move projection of $90K,” she wrote in a note.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t HelpingWildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the BenefitsHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in AmericaBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","November 24, 2021, 9:10 AM"

Avax has rallied this year along with the rest of the crypto complex, but what gave it this most recent boost was its tie-up with ""Big Four"" accounting firm Deloitte.""Avalanche has climbed 37% over the last 7 days whilst the rest of the top 10 cryptos have seen red. The significant driving factor for AVAX's entrance into the top 10 was the partnership with Deloitte, one of the ""Big Four"" accounting organizations and the largest professional services network in the world,"" GlobalBlock sales trader Freddie Williams said.Avalanche developer Ava Labs announced last Tuesday that it would partner with Deloitte to help simplify reimbursement applications for victims of natural disasters.Avax has rallied by almost 50% since then and was last up around 1.5% in 24 hours to $136.50 by 06:01 a.m. ET on Monday, according to Coingecko. Bitcoin meanwhile has lost almost 5% in that time, while dogecoin has shed around 6% and ether has fallen by 2%.Story continues""The new platform gives state and local officials a decentralized, low-cost and fully immutable system that empowers both the grant funders, and the aid recipients, while using the transparency of blockchain to minimize fraud, waste and abuse,"" Emin Gün Sirer, Ava Labs founder, tweeted Tuesday.Most major digital coins have come under fire this month, as factors such a stronger dollar, more evidence of China's crackdown on the sector and the potential for higher taxes on cryptocurrencies stemming from the new US infrastructure bill have weighed on the market.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 22, 2021, 3:22 AM"

The fund closed above its $30 million goal and has put money behind Bitwave, Lattice and BlockchainSpace.Asked to compare the Endeavor Fund to the NFT Fund, Maitra said Endeavor looks at early-stage investments across many sectors, including NFTs and gaming, but will predominantly invest in companies supporting NFT growth via equity and token investments.“The NFT fund focuses on investing in the actual NFTs themselves, many of which have immediate cash flows and yields and unique properties that accrue directly to the token holder,” Maitra told CoinDesk.Investment focuses for the Arca NFT Fund will include digital property, in-game assets, art and collectibles and how NFTs interact with decentralized finance (DeFi), to name a few.Arca’s NFT fund marks the latest venture capital bet on digital assets.

Its returned 460% on its investment and is tripling locations during the pandemic,"Aly Hamam (right), co-founder of Tahinis, shows a bitcoin ATM at one of its restaurants.TahinisTahinis is a family-based restaurant chain that invests all its profit in bitcoin, a strategy that's ""worked like a charm"" as it expands.Tahinis's co-founders say they're up 460% on the investment first made in August 2020 as a way to protect profit from surging inflation.The Canadian company says it's helped other small businesses adopt a ""bitcoin-standard"" strategy.Tahinis is a family-based restaurant chain that along with its Middle Eastern cuisine serves this advice to small-business owners everywhere: Invest in bitcoin.Tahinis is billed as the world's first restaurant chain to invest 100% of its cash reserves into the cryptocurrency. Its founders, brothers Aly and Omar Hamam, said bitcoin exposure has been key in aiding its expansion in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and soaring inflation that's sent prices soaring for ingredients they need for shawarma and other dishes. The company based in London, Ontario, Canada, first invested in bitcoin in August 2020.""We're up, to date, 460% on our initial investment and we didn't stop there,"" Tahinis chief marketing officer, Aly, told Insider in a recent interview. ""We will continue sweeping excess profit into bitcoins. We even bought the [April 2021 price] top and then rode it all the way down, and we just kept buying month after month after month. So it has worked like a charm for us,"" he said.Bitcoin in August 2020 traded under $12,000. It was around $58,075 as of Friday after last week's record high above $69,000.Tahinis follows a so-called ""bitcoin-standard strategy"" under which it operates in fiat currency, or Canadian dollars, then invests all profit into bitcoin, a move Aly said was similar to that of MicroStrategy's.The data analytics company uses excess cash to purchase what it sees as a ""dependable store of value."" MicroStrategy recently held 114,042 bitcoins, valued at about $6.8 billion as of Thursday. Aly for a while had ignored bitcoin after one of his financial idols - Warren Buffett - called it ""rat poison squared"" in 2018.Story continuesTahinis keeps working capital in cash for a few months and then the profit, part of its treasury, is sent into bitcoin. Privately owned Tahinis couldn't disclose how much bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet but said sales at its restaurants now exceed $8 million over the past year.The company in 2021 will expand to nine locations from eight and is on track in 2022 to have a total of 29 restaurants. Aly said Tahinis has worked with dozens of small businesses worldwide onboarding them to a bitcoin-standard strategy.""The main problem that we have right now is that dollars are devaluating,"" Aly said. ""Central banks will say inflation is only 5%. But that really depends on what you want to buy. Poultry is up 45%, beef is up 25%, imported goods and spices are up 65%, oils are up 110%,"" since March 2020, when the pandemic was accelerating, he said. ""So it made sense to put our money into [bitcoin] and that will outstrip any inflation rates we see for the coming decade.""The Hamams are sensitive to currency devaluation after seeing their parents' wealth and savings hurt by a 65% drop in the Egyptian pound against the US dollar between 2012 and 2017. The brothers were in Tahrir Square in 2011 during the Arab Spring uprising that led to the ouster of then-President Hosni Mubarak.""We faced the riot police, we got hit with tear gas,"" said Aly. ""We came to Canada the following year with a reinvigorated hope to start our new lives here,"" which led to Tahinis. The Hamams had previously obtained dual citizenship through their father who earned a Ph.D. in Canada and later worked as a mathematics professor in Saudi Arabia.Tahinis has installed bitcoin machines in every restaurant to encourage employees and customers to buy the cryptocurrency. It doesn't take bitcoin for food payments in part because accounting and tax reporting is much easier to operate in fiat currency and it wants to promote holding bitcoin.Tahinis started recovering from the pandemic in May 2020 after sales plummeted by 80% and forced layoffs. Along with bitcoin, having a quick-service restaurant model rather than an in-person dining model requiring more square footage to operate has helped.""We had more people sign up for franchises after COVID than before COVID,"" Omar Hamam, Tahinis CEO, told Insider.""We have a full marketing team that works every day to push out content to make people laugh,"" and to see Tahinis's food on TikTok and Instagram, said Omar, ""and that we have our own supply-chain company helps a lot. So we've really tackled the business from every aspect.""Read the original article on Business Insider","November 22, 2021, 5:10 AM"

Bitcoin is being heralded as an inflation hedge on a par with gold and ether is rapidly becoming the cryptocurrency of choice for decentralized finance, play-to-earn games, digital collectors' items, known as non-fungible tokens, and likely soon, the metaverse.But it's not either of these two cryptocurrencies that have captured the public's imagination.Dogecoin, which was founded by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmers in 2013 as a joke, has been the most searched-for cryptocurrency in the largest number of states so far this year, according to research by The Advisor Coach, a financial advisor. The coin, which is based on an internet meme of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog, was the most-googled in 23 states, including Florida, Illinois and Michigan.This year, it shot to prominence, thanks in large part to the Twitter-based cheerleading of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who is a known crypto enthusiast that holds dogecoin, bitcoin and ether. Musk even went so far as saying in May this year that he might accept dogecoin as payment for his company's electric vehicles.By that point, dogecoin was already beloved among the army of Reddit retail traders, who had pushed the coin up to around $0.07, from closer to $0.007 at the start of the year and Musk's payment remark sent the price to a record $0.70. It's since eased to around $0.24, but it's still one of the crypto stars of 2021, with a gain of nearly 5,000% so far.Story continues""The rise in interest can be partially attributed to the endorsement of Elon Musk who stated earlier in the year that Tesla would accept dogecoin as a form of payment,"" The Advisor Coach note said.Crypto traders' adoration of Musk extends well beyond what coins he holds and has given rise to dogecoin spinoffs. The Tesla boss even owns a Shiba Inu. There's now a shiba inu coin, and even a floki inu, named after Musk's real-life pup, Floki.By contrast, bitcoin, the biggest and original cryptocurrency, was the most-searched for in just 10 states, including Connecticut, Alaska and Mississippi, ranking it second in the list. Bitcoin has led the surge in appetite for and adoption of cryptocurrencies.

Crypto exchanges are increasingly cautious over privacy coins, especially given the growing scrutiny from regulators.Bittrex said at the beginning of this year that it would stop clients trading privacy coins, including monero, dash and zcash.

And this week, it was all about the ConstitutionDAO.For those who weren't online last week, here's what you missed: a not-so-subtle group of strangers on the internet banded together to try to buy one of the remaining thirteen copies for the constitution. With crypto. The bold bid eventually fell short, but many saw it as an inspiring onramp into how communities can mobilize around a shared goal in a Web3 world. The whole movement, from its meme start to its poetic, and billionaire Ken Griffin-themed, end, was just too interesting for Equity to not dedicate an entire episode to.So, Natasha and Alex brought on Lucas Matney and Anita Ramaswamy to unpack, decompress, and bond over our shared experience of witnessing this 'financial flash mob.'We talked about what a DAO is, and what they might be used for. We dug into the question of just how many folks the effort really brought to the larger ""Web3"" space. And, of course, we had to talk about gas fees, NFTs, and the pace of innovation in crypto more broadly. Lucas even broke out an excellent analogy to explain level-two chains!The crew were generally bullish on the blockchain economy, if skeptical of some of its current uses. In short, the potential remains potent in crypto even if some of its projects, today at least, are a bit more boring than breakthrough. Crypto,we're told, is going to shake up the world.

It also dominated the news cycle late Friday after Citadel CEO Ken Griffin revealed that he defeated the loosely-organized group of investors in a bidding war that broke records.So, what's next for the DAO? A couple of things.""We'll soon be proposing a plan that outlines governance, vision, and values, for the community to review and comment on,"" the group said in a five-part Twitter thread Sunday.But generally speaking, it proposed two routes for the cohort of around 17,000 people who banded together to raise an extraordinary sum.First, investors who want to opt out can get their ""ETH back at the original rate,"" the group said. For easier tracking of claimed and unclaimed funds, the group added it will make a website in the coming week in block 13656500.The DAO did remind investors on its existing website of gas fees, which are required in every transaction. Some, especially those new to the digital asset ecosystem, may have failed to realize this at the get-go.Second, investors who want to invest in another object can sign a message — without paying for gas — committing their funds to the DAO's treasury and getting the group's token called WTP, the group said.WTP stands for We The People, which gives holders the ability to vote for what direction future efforts of the DAO will take. There is no expectation to profit when donating to ConstitutionDAO.DAOs are internet communities that pull capital together and decide collectively how to invest it. ConstitutionDAO started as a joke on Twitter after Sotheby's announced the sale of one of 13 remaining copies of the US Constitution.Story continuesLast week, Griffin won the auction and purchased the 1787 copy for $43.2 million, a new world record for the most valuable historical document ever sold at an auction. The CEO said he intends to lend it to an Arkansas art museum for free.ConstitutionDAO on its website admitted it was disappointed its ethereum-based project did not succeed in achieving its goal but decided to end the Twitter thread on an optimistic note.""We onboarded thousands into crypto and educated millions about DAOs.

Some analysts say that’s unsurprising since a rival bitcoin futures ETF launched by ProShares several weeks earlier appears to have leapt to a first-mover advantage.As of Friday, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF – stock ticker BITO – had net assets of $1.4 billion. It was the first bitcoin futures ETF to go live in October after winning the approval of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Such assets dwarf the $57 million for Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures ETF (ticker BTF), launched a few days later, and the $8.7 million reported for the VanEck ETF, which didn’t come to market until last week.The ProShares ETF held onto its dominance even though it’s a more expensive investment vehicle, with a higher net expense ratio, at 0.95%, than the VanEck ETF (ticker XBTF), at 0.65%.“It is harder to gain traction when you come to market weeks later,” Todd Rosenbluth, the head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research told CoinDesk.ProShares $1 billionThe first-mover advantage was initially visible from reports on trading volume.When the VanEck’s bitcoin futures ETF started trading last week on the Chicago-based CBOE exchange, it drew only around $5 million of first-day volume.The ProShares ETF, by contrast, hit a trading volume of about $1 billion by the end of its first day.Deborah Fuhr, managing partner and founder of ETFGI, which tracks the ETF industry, said that “there is a significant first-mover advantage in the ETFs and ETPs business.“First mover takes most of the assets and trading volume,” she said. “This is a phenomenon that has existed in the U.S. for many years.”Bitcoin ETFsThe cool reception for XBTF looks like a double disappointment for the sponsor, since VanEck’s application for a spot bitcoin ETF – backed by actual units of the cryptocurrency, rather than futures contracts – was rejected by the SEC on Nov. 12.Story continuesValkyrie Funds CEO Leah Wald said the Van Eck ETF launch may have simply been a victim of bad timing: launching into a broad sell-off in digital asset markets. Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell about 10% in the seven days through Sunday, the biggest weekly decline in two months.The ProShares ETF, by contrast, launched just as bitcoin was pressing toward a new all-time high just below $69,000.“The factors that contributed to the down market had nothing to do with them and can be chalked up to nothing more than a bit of bad luck,” Wald said. “Let’s not forget that other much larger asset managers were unable to achieve launching such a product. Bringing a BTC futures fund to market is a victory on its own. Unlike those firms, Van Eck at least has a seat at the table.”She went on to stress that launching an ETF is about much more than just day one, adding that Valkyrie Funds continues to see “robust demand in BTF.”“Since the moment we launched our fund, we expected this to be about more than launch day, and continue to believe that is the case,” said Wald.She added that there clearly is demand for exposure to bitcoin in a compliant, regulated vehicle and doesn’t expect that enthusiasm to wane anytime soon.“Winning hearts and minds is a long-term effort,” Wald said. “We are still in the top of the first inning.”Key Bitcoin Price Level at $60KThe launch of VanEck’s bitcoin futures ETF was “unexpectedly later than announced,” so it’s possible that investors who were interested in a bitcoin futures ETF had already placed their bets, said Laurent Kssis, director of CEC Capital, a crypto trading advisory firm.“This is a temporary glitch coupled with the higher volatility of bitcoin, which has scared new and existing investors as BTC dropped from its high and broke below the important $60K level,” he said. “So for now, new investors are holding back on what could lead to further downward pressures.”Read more: VanEck Bitcoin Futures ETF Finds Cool Reception","November 22, 2021, 6:24 AM"
27,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/only-21-brits-aware-non-174300941.html,Only 21% of Brits are aware of what an non-fungible token is,"Research from financial comparison site Finder.com has unveiled some surprising statistics regarding global awareness of the wild and wacky world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs).A global survey of more than 28,000 adults across 20 countries taken in September revealed that just one in five Brits (21%) said they know what an NFT is, while 3.3% of Brits plan on buying an NFT at “some point in the future”.This would equate to around 1.7 million people in the UK owning an NFT – a small percentage compared to the rest of the world.The data shows that the UK ranks third bottom of the list, propped up by Japan and Germany.Surprisingly, considering its reputation as a tech-forward country, NFT awareness in the US sits at only 30%.More crypto-native countries such as the Philippines have shown the highest level of awareness at 51%, which can largely be put down to the explosion of Axie Infinity within the country.This is closely followed by the 48% of Nigerians that have heard of NFTs, which is related to the country being one of the most prominent users of crypto assets and peer-to-peer exchanges in the world.Nigeria also ranks top on the NFT adoption scale, which measures the number of people who don’t own one but plan to in the future. It tops the list with 21%, followed by a trio of South American countries looking to get involved. Once again, the United States sits at the opposite end of the spectrum, with just 3.9% – approximately 13m Americans – saying they have an interest in buying one.Commenting on the NFT space, finder.com’s cryptocurrency editor, Keegan Francis, spoke of the growing popularity and earnings potential attached to digital artworks.“In some of these countries, people are quitting their jobs because they can make money trading NFTs or earning them in games. They can be a great gateway to cryptocurrency ownership, especially because many games don’t require ID,” he said.“If you want to buy NFTs directly then you’ll need to set up a wallet, purchase cryptocurrency, and choose an NFT marketplace.”","November 24, 2021, 9:43 AM"

29,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/misinformation-book-twitter-killed-literary-143000061.html,How Misinformation on ‘Book Twitter’ Killed a Literary NFT Project,"Once upon a time, there was a wasteland teeming with deadly monsters and dark magic. The only thing stopping the wasteland’s evil forces from escaping was a magical wall maintained by five kingdoms. But as war brewed, the wall began to crumble.What happens next? That’s for you to decide.At least, that was the initial plan for “Realms of Ruin,” a collaborative storytelling project helmed by former Facebook executive Julie Zhuo and a team of best-selling young adult (YA) fantasy and science-fiction authors. Marie Lu, Tahereh Mafi, Ransom Riggs, Adam Silvera, David Yoon and Nicola Yoon were all signed on.The established authors involved in the project planned to kick-start the story with origin lore and 12 character backstories, and then hand over the reins to the “Realms of Ruin” community for dreaming up new characters and story lines within the universe.Built on the Solana blockchain, fans could mint their stories as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), buy and trade character art NFTs and talk with one another on Discord about the universe they were building. The authors would, according to an archived version of the project’s now-defunct website, “be reading closely to decide which stories and characters are compelling enough to become canon.”Essentially author-approved fan fiction for the Web 3 age, “Realms of Ruin” seemed exciting and ambitious – some even described it as inevitable – until a teaser for the project launched on Twitter and Instagram on Oct. 20.Instead of eager fans, the authors were met with suspicion that quickly turned to collective anger.The online writing community banded together to discuss the apparent dangers of the project. Twitter users decried the environmental impact of NFTs, accused the authors of running a Ponzi scheme and a grift to steal contributors’ intellectual property and debated the morality of marketing the project to minors.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.In less than five hours, “Realms of Ruin” was scrapped. The authors involved deleted their earlier announcements and replaced them with apologies. Before long, the apologies were deleted, too, along with other mentions of the project online. Book Twitter celebrated its victory.Story continuesNo matter that Solana, a proof-of-stake blockchain, didn’t intersect at all with the environmental costs for which “Realms of Ruin” was being pilloried. Proof-of-work, the energy-intensive technology behind the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains that requires specialized computers to “mine” new coins, has long drawn the ire of crypto skeptics. Proof-of-stake has no such mechanism.The controversy revealed a rich vein of mainstream distrust of crypto projects, especially when environmental impact is involved. It also showed there’s no room for technical nuance in the heat of online battle.‘Climate’ catastropheThe negative reaction to “Realms of Ruin” was nearly instantaneous. Book Twitter expressed a range of issues with the project, the most common of which was the environmental impact of NFTs.Legitimate concerns gave way to hyperbole and misunderstandings as fans condemned the “absolute climate carnage of NFTs.”When Marie Lu, one of the authors involved with the project, tweeted that the Solana blockchain was “eco-friendly” and asked people to “Please do your homework before spreading misinformation,” fans mocked her.Read more: What Is Proof-of-Stake?“Marie Lu really said no babe, my NFTs only burn down a *quarter* of the Amazon rainforest, check your facts,” one account tweeted.When confused Twitter users asked for explanations of why NFTs were so bad, other members of the online writing community stepped in to explain, offering tweets and explainer threads that often cited articles about proof-of-work mining – if they cited anything at all.Crypto insiders were quickly outmatched.“It started with an assumption that Solana was incredibly destructive to the environment, which is not true,” Austin Federa, head of communications at Solana Labs, told CoinDesk. “Full stop, it takes about 10 times as much energy to boil water from room temperature than it takes to mint an NFT on Solana.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.A source close to the project who asked not to be named told CoinDesk that Solana was chosen for its comparative sustainability.Despite this, the source said the team still anticipated pushback about NFTs, which prompted them to add a section to the “Realms of Ruin” website about Solana’s energy usage.The site read: “While many popular NFT platforms use the Ethereum blockchain which consumes large amounts of energy and is extremely expensive, the Solana blockchain has transaction costs below $0.01 and is very energy efficient. In fact, in the time you spent reading this, your body has burnt more calories in energy than it takes to mint a story on the Solana blockchain!”But fans remained suspicious of Solana’s environmental impact. Rumors of the project being a scheme to pump Solana’s native SOL token exploded when one Twitter user pointed out a small rise in the coin’s price that correlated with the “Realms of Ruin” teaser announcement.“There’s never been an NFT project on Solana whose volume was significant enough to impact trading,” Federa said.Minting doesn’t cost a mintMisunderstandings about the cost to mint an NFT on Solana also swirled through Book Twitter.The now-deleted “Realms of Ruin” announcement teased a “robust collection of original character NFTs” (though the price of these NFTs was never listed or otherwise made clear to potential participants), and touted the “low transaction costs of Solana.”With little information to go on, fans on Twitter began to speculate as to the cost of minting NFTs. On the project’s Discord, which has also been deleted, potential participants asked moderators to explain the process of minting NFTs.“From what I’ve understood from the post in #announcements, you pay to have the story turned into an NFT,” one user wrote.“So, you’re basically paying to upload your story?” another asked.On Twitter, some users speculated that it could cost up to $300 to mint an NFT on Solana. To be fair, such fees are not unheard of on Ethereum, where transaction fees are much higher.“The average cost to mint and use an NFT on Solana is approximately 35 cents,” Federa told CoinDesk. “From a transaction fee perspective, the cost of actually issuing and setting up an NFT or transferring it to someone is pennies.”Discord users pushed back against moderators, and pointed out that the majority of crypto exchanges require customers to be over the age of 18. On Twitter, they denounced the immorality of marketing the project to teenagers (despite over half of young adult literature readers being, well, adults).A Discord moderator called “redshirt” tried to quell fans’ rising panic about the mining costs by telling them that there were tentative plans to establish a treasury that would be filled by a percentage of proceeds from each NFT sold – both the character NFTs and the NFTs of the stories themselves.“We’re hoping to have a way for people who can’t purchase SOL to request a small amount from our shared treasury for minting stories,” redshirt wrote. “That way anyone with a story to tell can create it. More info to come soon.”But the promise of “more info to come’' didn’t sit well with fans. Before long the authors involved with the project were getting what Federa described as “serious threats” from upset fans.“My understanding is they got like, not death threats, but like, ‘You’re a horrible person, you’re ruining people’s lives, you’re selling out…’ Like real vicious betrayal stuff,” Federa said.Who retains the IP?Potential participants also expressed concerns about the lack of clarity as to who would own the copyright and intellectual property on any stories published within the “Realms of Ruin” universe.Conflicting information on the “Realms of Ruin” website seems to have been the source for the majority of users’ fears. One disclaimer gave copyright to the six authors involved, but in the website’s FAQ section, the project’s leaders assert that fans “truly own the stories you write, we will help you mint (publish) your stories as NFTs. Once you have minted an NFT, we can never take it away from you.”“This does feel like a witch hunt, done in a way that was really, really unhelpful.”Lia Holland, Fight for the FutureAccording to Moish Peltz, a New York-based attorney who specializes in the intersection of NFTs and intellectual property, original works of authorship are covered by copyright protection laws the moment they are created and fixed in a tangible form – like NFTs – but the nature of fan fiction makes “Realms of Ruin” a more complicated case.“However, once [the participants] are given permission to create the derivative works, they would presumably maintain ownership of their derivative works, unless there was some agreement to the contrary,” said Peltz.CoinDesk’s source seconded this, and explained that the team intended to create a profit tree structure that would give varying percentages of any money generated from NFT sales to authors involved in a given story line – both the professional authors who kick-started the project, and the participants who created NFT stories in the “chain.”However, this profit tree was never fully fleshed out or detailed on the “Realms of Ruin” website, which added to fans’ confusion.Participants also expressed concerns about hypothetical future copyright issues, like how participants would be rewarded if “Realms of Ruin” was ever made into a movie or television series.According to Peltz, there was some validity in participants’ fears.“Nothing in [the ‘Realms of Ruin’ FAQ] speaks to what rights the project might have to use the submitted fan fiction and what rights might be reserved to authors, nor whether participants could expect to receive any financial considerations for the contributions of their fan fiction to the project,” Peltz told CoinDesk.Questions in the Discord piled up faster than redshirt could answer, and users began speculating and answering each other’s questions. It quickly became clear that redshirt and the other moderators simply didn’t have answers to a lot of the participants’ questions.“NFTs and copyright are still the wild west,” redshirt wrote in response to a user comment about copyright issues. “But we want to act in good faith and take feedback from you all to make this fair and a success.”But promises of good faith did nothing to staunch the flow of questions or the eddying fears in the Discord.Tech or culture?Aside from the six established authors associated with the effort, the names of the people involved with the project were never posted on the “Realms of Ruin” website. Zhuo – the former Facebook VP – seems to have spearheaded the project.In a now-deleted Medium post, Zhuo wrote that she’d been inspired by Loot, the text-based fantasy NFT game.“NFTs are in a renaissance,” Zhuo wrote. “But something seemed missing. Stories.”Read more: The Latest NFT Fad Is a Text-Based Fantasy Game Building BlockDespite the involvement of the established authors, “Realms of Ruin” appears to have operated as a tech venture rather than a publishing one. And unlike the dynamic and ever-changing tech industry, the publishing industry is known for its adherence to tradition and distrust of new technologies.In retrospect, it seems as though Zhuo and her team had an abundance of enthusiasm and a partially fleshed-out idea when the announcement dropped (although to be fair, the announcement came over two weeks ahead of the project’s planned release date, and the team could have figured out the sticking points before then).CoinDesk’s source said that no one on the team was expecting the hostility that the announcement was met with. But, in hindsight, the lack of clarity mixed with the tech-averse nature of the book community made “Realms of Ruin” a recipe for disaster.Could Web 3 fix publishing?Lia Holland, the campaigns and communications director at Fight for the Future – a non-profit that advocates for digital rights like privacy and net neutrality – was one of the first to step into the fray and defend Zhuo and the “Realms of Ruin” team.Holland, who is unaffiliated with the project, found out about “Realms of Ruin” not through her work with Fight for the Future, but through her speculative fiction writers’ group.As an author herself, Holland was appalled by Book Twitter’s knee-jerk reaction to what she saw as an innovative and potentially transformative approach to publishing.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Holland’s tweets also called attention to the rampant misinformation spreading on Twitter:“All these threads I’m reading are like ‘I don’t know anything about NFTs, please don’t make me learn. But I KNOW they are awful and going to melt the planet. No, I’m not reading the website to learn about how little energy their set up would use,’” she wrote.In a Fight for the Future podcast released the day after the project’s cancellation, Holland broke down the drama with her coworker, Ayele B. Hunt.According to Hunt, Book Twitter’s “nuclearly reactive” response to “Realms of Ruin” wasn’t totally unexpected.“Authors have been betrayed at every turn by the existing actors,” Hunt said, referring to Amazon and the traditional publishing industry. “Their suspicion of new things has a foundation in fact. These gatekeepers have toxified and toxified the space … and put investors over artists to the point that anything new can look like a scam.”In an interview with CoinDesk, Holland reiterated Hunt’s point.“Authors and people in the publishing space have been deeply betrayed, over and over again, by the existing structures they work in,” Holland said. “There’s been so much consolidation and concentration and lessening of resources for authors. The space, especially for people who are not published, is often full of traps and scams.”The deep well of skepticism is merited, she said.However, Holland remained emphatic that Book Twitter’s immediate negative reaction to the “Realms of Ruin” announcement was uncalled for.“This does feel like a witch hunt, done in a way that was really, really unhelpful and didn’t create enough space to have a conversation about this platform and what it was trying to do,” she said.","November 22, 2021, 6:30 AM"

Grayscale estimated that revenue from virtual gaming worlds could grow to $400 billion in 2025, from around $180 billion in 2020.Yet Grayscale, which runs the world's biggest cryptocurrency fund, said the metaverse is still ""in its early innings.""

But it might create new ways of earning money.Many current metaverse projects, such as virtual realities or games, are run by so-called Web2 companies, which are centralized and operate for profit. Facebook, which has launched the virtual reality space Horizon Worlds, is an example.But increasingly, metaverse projects are created on or are heavily tied to crypto technology, which can give users more control and allow them to earn money that they can use in the real world. This is known as the Web3 metaverse.Grayscale listed the opportunities for monetization of consumers within the Web3 metaverse. These include art galleries launching NFTs, games and casinos where players win crypto, digital advertising billboards, and music venues where DJs and artists hold concerts.In the third quarter, total Web3 and NFT fundraising hit $1.8 billion, out of overall crypto fundraising of $8.2 billion, Grayscale said. It added that investment has ""recently started to accelerate.""Grayscale's report focused on Decentraland. In that metaverse, people log in to play games, earn the native cryptocurrency mana, purchase NFTs including virtual land and collectibles, and vote on the governance of the economy.The crypto investment company recently created a Decentraland trust that invests solely in mana.

It seems society has suddenly propelled back to the future as we have seen nations start to adopt a phenomenon known to many as crypto — the world’s newest medium of exchange.The best way to describe crypto is as the digital currency it is, thinking of the many different types of cryptocurrency as currencies with different utilities. The one quality that they all share is that they contribute to the creation of a richer digital experience.The Bitcoin logo appears on the display screen of a cryptocurrency ATM at the Smoker’s Choice store in Salem, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)The challenging part is understanding that cryptocurrency fluctuates rapidly and can be volatile — sparking the interest of investors and micro-investors throughout the world who are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. Some experts believe cryptocurrency is all about timing and crypto-believers argue that cash and the USD is archaic and truly the inferior form of currency … but are these investors right?It is impossible to demystify the secret of cryptocurrency without answering the infamous question — what is blockchain? Often discussed in tandem, many mix up the idea of cryptocurrency with blockchain, and others simply don’t know the difference.Blockchain is a decentralized technology that is incredibly secure (think of the root of the word crypto — as in encryption). The benefit of blockchains is that its technology is spread across many different computer operating systems, thus arguably making them more secure than existing payment systems.Easily accessible crypto-wallets like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Gemini, have made it easy to buy and sell over 50 different cryptocurrencies. Gemini is particularly interesting because of its founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who started the company in 2014.If you ever watched The Social Network, you will remember the Winklevoss Twins — the two brothers that infamously founded HarvardConnection, a social media network on Harvard’s campus that predated Facebook. Although the Winklevoss brothers seemed to have lost the Facebook war, they continue to prove themselves as formidable opponents to Mark Zuckerberg in the “Metaverse”— going on to found one of cryptocurrency’s leading exchanges.Story continuesHowever, while the Winklevoss brothers have used this and their other investments to propel them into the billionaire stratosphere along with their rival Zuckerberg — cryptocurrency has always had a different meaning for Black and Brown people.For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberation. In this case, it comes as no surprise that Black people have been, by and large, leading the cryptocurrency boom. The University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center reports that 46% of cryptocurrency holders are people of color — with 18% of those holders being Black. These numbers make sense considering the deep seated distrust in the Black community surrounding government regulation and the wealth gap.The Bitcoin logo is displayed on the side of a Bitcoin ATM on November 10, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)To many, cryptocurrency will serve as the great equalizer that education was once viewed as in this country. Accessibility is another reason for cryptocurrency’s success within the Black community. Investors can purchase cryptocurrency at a painfully low entry point — you only need a dollar to buy crypto as you can fractionally invest in currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum buying a minute fraction of the coin.This enables folks with less disposable income to get in on the fun whereas the stock market has traditionally excluded these population groups. But cryptocurrency has implications that span far larger than just Black America. Cryptocurrency has also become a force to be reckoned with on the forefront of the global community. This has left many economists asking the question of what crypto means for the global economy?Akon was perhaps one of the first celebrities to openly discuss cryptocurrency and its ramifications, as early as 2018, when he declared his own cryptocurrency, Akoin. Akon noted that this cryptocurrency would guide Africa into financial freedom and be the basis upon which his futuristic city would be built.If Akon’s plan does succeed, it would liberate the Senegalese people from the French-backed CFA (the national currency of Senegal and many Francophone countries in West Africa). But Senegal isn’t the only African country interested in cryptocurrency. Nigeria has quickly grown to be the second largest market for crypto trading, following the United States.Akon attends the Jingle Bell Ball at the O2 Arena on December 5, 2010 in London, England. (Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)Many Nigerians have found the use of cryptocurrency as a solvent way to protect their money against the depreciation of the Naira (which is linked to the USD.) Moreover, cryptocurrency simplifies the transference of remittances (money sent back home by nationals or family members who live internationally) and minimizes costs and fees. The issue of remittances is a phenomenon that can be seen throughout the African continent and across the pond in the Caribbean and Latin America as well.El Salvador has led the Latin American community in cryptocurrency, becoming the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. Both President Nayib Bukele and Maria Luisa Hayem, El Salvador’s Minister of Economy, are proud to have led Latin America into this innovative economic revolution. Despite their efforts, adoption has been slow, with only 12% of consumers using cryptocurrency since the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in September.Yet not all countries have bought into the hype, with China banning all crypto-related transactions and deeming them illegal. Crypto economist and attorney Jamar Montgomery thinks it’s because “open source cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are a threat to a government’s control over a monetary and financial system.”While these governments desperately cling to the little financial control they have left — the rest of the world seems to be moving toward a new age. With even the infamous Los Angeles Staples Arena being renamed and rebranded to reflect a new moniker, “crypto.com,” it is certainly reflective of the new age of cryptocurrency.Wen-Kuni Ceant, theGrio.comWen-kuni Ceant is the CEO and Co-Founder of Politicking.

We'll also look at a sharp drop in jobless claims and a new nominee for White House budget chief.But first, a very Happy Thanksgiving from The Hill family to yours. We're taking the rest of the week off and will be back in your inbox Monday evening.For The Hill, I'm Sylvan Lane. Write me at slane@thehill.com or @SylvanLane. You can reach my colleagues on the Finance team Naomi Jagoda at njagoda@thehill.com or @NJagoda and Aris Folley at afolley@thehill.com or @ArisFolley.Let's get to it. Biden eyes new path for Fed President BidenPresident Biden emphasized continuity and bipartisanship when making his picks for the top two positions at the Federal Reserve this week. But his next slate of nominees could establish an enduring left-leaning majority at the central bank.Biden on Monday announced he would renominate Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, a Republican well-liked in both parties, and appoint Lael Brainard - the only Democrat on the bank's Board of Governors - as vice chair.But Biden still has three seats on the seven-person Fed board to fill and the vacant vice chairmanship of supervision, which sets the Fed's regulatory agenda, and he says that his new picks won't be quite like the last. The president said his next nominees will ""bring new perspectives and new voices,"" along with ""long overdue"" diversity to the Fed board. ""With three open seats and the vice chair for supervision, there is still a lot of leeway for Biden to make a meaningful and distinct imprint on the trajectory of the Federal Reserve,"" said Kathryn Judge, a banking law professor at Columbia University.""The continuity Biden tried to signal is really a commitment to support the monetary policy and the focus on unemployment that Powell has spearheaded during his leadership, but there's a lot of other issues that could be addressed by the Federal Reserve in coming years.""Story continuesI'll tell you what that means here.LEADING THE DAYJobless claims plunge to 199K, lowest level since 1969New weekly claims for jobless aid plunged to the lowest level in more than 50 years last week, according to data released Wednesday by the Labor Department.In the week ending Nov. 20, there were 199,000 initial applications for unemployment insurance, according to the seasonally adjusted figures, a decline of 71,000 from the previous week. Claims fell to the lowest level since November 1969 and are now well below the pre-pandemic trough of 225,000 applications received the week of March 14, 2020.The steep drop in unemployment applications comes after several strong months of job growth and rising consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. While high inflation has stressed many household budgets, U.S. job growth, economic production, stock values and corporate profits have all steamed ahead.The caveat: The steep drop was likely due to the Labor Department expecting far more seasonal layoffs than the country experienced last month, one of several ways the pandemic has skewed economic data. But even if claims rebound toward normal levels next week, it will mark a strong improvement.BIDEN'S BUDGET PICKBiden taps Shalanda Young to lead White House budget officePresident Biden on Wednesday announced his plans to nominate Shalanda Young as director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) after the longtime Capitol Hill aide spent months serving as acting director.If confirmed, Young would be the first Black woman to run the agency. She has served as acting director since Neera Tanden's nomination for OMB director was withdrawn in March.Biden also announced his intent to nominate Nani Coloretti as deputy director of the OMB. Coloretti would become one of the highest ranking Asian American or Pacific Islanders in the administration if confirmed.The OMB has been without Senate-confirmed leadership for the entirety of the Biden administration thus far after Tanden withdrew her nomination in the face of bipartisan opposition.The agency is responsible for overseeing the formulation and implementation of the federal government's budget. Biden referred to it in Wednesday's video as the ""nerve center"" of the government.Brett Samuels has more here.SHOPPING SPREEIncomes, consumer spending rose in October even as inflation spikedConsumer spending rose in October despite a surge of inflation as higher personal incomes helped buffet rising prices, according to data released Wednesday by the Commerce Department.Personal consumption expenditures rose 1.3 percent last month, powered by a 1 percent increase in spending on goods and a 0.7 percent rise in spending on services. Consumer spending on goods has run far ahead of services due to a combination of supply chain snarls, coronavirus-related restrictions and changes in consumption habits driven by the pandemic.The PCE index rose 0.6 percent in October after three straight months of 0.4 percent increases in consumer prices. The index also rose 5 percent during the year leading into October - a 0.6 percentage point increase in the annual inflation rate from September.I break it down here. Good to KnowFederal Reserve officials debated this month whether the bank should be prepared to taper asset purchases and raise interest rates quicker than they once expected as inflation spiked, according to minutes released Wednesday.Here's what else we have our eye on:A majority of registered voters blame President Biden and Congress for the global supply chain and delivery issues affecting Americans, according to a new poll.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday apologized after he made what he called ""a joke"" saying the bank would outlast the Chinese Communist Party.That's it for today.

Powell helped to steer the world’s biggest economy through the COVID-19 pandemic, notably doubling the size of the central bank’s balance sheet to $8.7 trillion to stimulate global markets.“That success is a testament to the economic agenda I’ve pursued and to the decisive action that the Federal Reserve has taken under Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard to help steer us through the worst downturn in modern American history and put us on the path to recovery,” Biden said in a statement.Bitcoin quadrupled in price in 2020 and has doubled so far in 2021, as a growing number of investors bought the cryptocurrency as a hedge against the inflation that might come as a result of so much money printing.With Powell as chairman and Brainard as vice chairwoman, Biden said he expects that the duo will help keep the focus on low inflation, stable prices and provide more employment for the American people, as well as address Biden’s stance on climate change.“Together, they also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change, and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system,” Biden added.Powell vs. Brainard, and what it means for cryptoEconomists have previously stated that differences between the two candidates’ positions – on both digital-asset regulation and economic policy – are so slight and finely nuanced that either choice likely wouldn’t have made a huge difference for the industry or cryptocurrency markets.Despite Brainard being more outspoken about cryptocurrencies out of the two, generally speaking, both share a conviction that cryptocurrencies should not be allowed to grow unfettered to the point where they might threaten the existing financial system.Story continuesMoreover, both candidates were seen as monetary policy “doves” – meaning they would likely be more tolerant of inflation, if given a choice. That might be a positive for bitcoin given the cryptocurrency’s use by many investors as a hedge against rising prices.The price of bitcoin has barely changed on Monday, hanging around $58,000, while ether, the native token of Ethereum, held its ground around $4,200.Traders in traditional markets seem to have taken the news as a positive, with the S&P 500 up about 0.7% in early trading on Monday.Powell was appointed as Fed chairman by then President Donald Trump and took office in February 2018, for a four-year term ending in February 2022.

41,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/former-oilfield-drillers-see-energy-162750759.html,Former Oilfield Drillers See Energy Sector and Bitcoin Mining Joining Forces,"Drilling for oil and gas and mining for bitcoin might seem like an odd couple.One is more than 150 years old. The other has existed for a little over a decade. One is a staple of industrial development, squarely grounded in the world of atoms. The other is an innovation of a digital era, financial plumbing for the world of bits. One involves sweaty outdoor work. The other involves a lot of math and abstraction inside cavernous air-conditioned data centers.If the founders of bitcoin miner JAI Energy are right, the two industries are an ideal match.Based in Casper, Wyo., (population: 58,446), these oil-and-gas veterans are on a mission to leave no energy stranded. Their thesis is that miners and drillers can solve each other’s problems: The crypto miners get a cheap source of electricity for their power-guzzling computers; the drillers can diversify their revenue sources and not have to waste vast amounts of excess energy produced at their current operations.“Every oil and gas company in five-10 years from now will have some exposure to mining bitcoin,” Ryan Leachman, a founding partner of JAI, said in a recent interview with CoinDesk.Read more: How Bitcoin Mining WorksDrilling and producing oil and gas has been plagued by a lack of infrastructure to transport the fossil fuels. After drilling in Wyoming and encountering that obstacle, Leachman and fellow JAI founding partner Justin Ballard turned to bitcoin mining to reduce so-called flaring of natural gas, as state regulations would have otherwise required them to close their drilled oil and gas well.Flaring natural gasFlaring of natural gas, where the excess gas is burned if encountered while drilling for fossil fuels, has become a standard industry practice because of the lack of transportation infrastructure. The process is under environmental scrutiny and U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to cut methane emissions from oil and gas operations, at a time when investors are increasingly prioritizing climate-friendly companies in their portfolios.Story continuesA scenario of net-zero emissions by 2050 requires all non-emergency flaring to be eliminated globally by 2030, resulting in a 90% reduction in flared volumes by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).JAI’s “digital flare mitigation,” or using flared gas to power bitcoin mining, could be one way to help address the environmental concerns regarding the burning of natural gas.To reduce the amount of gas burned, Leachman and Ballard in 2019 switched gears to form a bitcoin mining operation where they capture the flared gas, convert it to electricity and use it to power mining rigs. At its 12-acre mining farm in Wyoming, JAI mines bitcoin for itself and hosts machines for energy companies that may want to mine for bitcoin using excess flared gas. JAI also provides products and services for companies to capture their excess energy.Read more: Bitcoin Mining Is Reshaping the Energy Sector and No One Is Talking About ItNow, Leachman and Ballard are expanding to Texas. The Lone Star State offers competitive rates for power, and JAI’s founders know the state well from their oil and gas days. One of JAI’s larger-scale projects in Texas will be “on-grid” as opposed to off-grid, meaning they will be drawing power from the electrical grid rather than from sources such as excess natural gas or solar power.“Ultimately, we are trying to set ourselves up with sites that have the lowest power costs with an ability to continue to scale and grow our company,” Leachman said.Bitcoin energy use in TexasTexas has been at the forefront of grid and power concerns after the state experienced harsh winter storms earlier this year that prompted electrical outages. Even some bitcoin miners had to go offline. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz spoke at a blockchain summit in Austin last month, where he touted the benefits of having bitcoin miners on the grid as a source of interruptible load.Bitcoin miners can aid “demand response” programs, which refers to formal or informal agreements to curtail demand when the grid is overtaxed and prices are high, CoinDesk reported last month following the summit. Bitcoin miners can also adjust their consumption to a level demanded by a grid operator during certain periods. Critics argue that merely adding new demand to the grid won’t solve Texas’ power problems.However, Crusoe Energy, which is another firm that provides digital flare mitigation systems, thinks that bitcoin miners, renewable energy providers and grid operators have a chance to coexist, highlighting one of the company’s upcoming Texas projects that has connections to local power grids.“In this setup, what we’re able to provide the renewable power generation company is a curtailable load resource,” CEO Chase Lochmiller told CoinDesk in an interview. “So we can actually curtail the draw of our machines during moments of peak power demand, and then we can consume all of the power during off-peak demand.”He added that Crusoe has the ability to be the “buyer of last resort” when energy generated by renewable sources of energy isn’t being fully consumed and expects companies such as his to be “a mechanism to incentivize more renewable energy development.”Bitcoin mining and ESG concernsBitcoin’s massive energy consumption has created concerns about its impact on the environment. Even though some industry executives have pushed back against the narrative that bitcoin mining is bad for the environment, many miners including Atlas Mining, CleanSpark and Stronghold Digital Mining are all using more sustainable sources of power for their operations.A survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry forum, found that sustainable power has grown to about 58% of the total used by the industry worldwide during the third quarter from 3% in the second quarter. The increase is partly due to the rapid expansion of North American mining amid the exodus from China, and miners rotating toward more sustainable energy and modern mining techniques.Traditional oil and gas companies may benefit financially from mining bitcoin, though that situation could continue to provide incentives for fossil fuel production, according to Matthew Schultz, chairman of bitcoin miner CleanSpark. Schultz said he isn’t convinced that large energy producers will take a bitcoin mining route, in light of ESG (environmental, social and governance) questions.Read more: What Is Proof-of-Work?Energy firms might think, “‘We’re already flaring the gas, why not make something out of it?’ I think that that’s an easy conclusion,” Schultz said in an interview with CoinDesk. However, if the flared gas becomes economically beneficial for an oil and gas company, it would become more likely to drill another well that’s going to have stranded gas, which would harm the environment further, he cautioned.CleanSpark says it runs its operations with over 90% of carbon-neutral energy sourced primarily from nuclear, hydroelectric, solar and other renewable sources of energy.Environmental critics might push for oil and gas producers to cap their wells altogether, versus opting to mine bitcoin with the excess gas; most flaring, however, occurs where natural gas is produced as a byproduct from oil drilling and where non-fossil fuel energy isn’t reliable enough yet to meet global energy needs. Cleaning up the wasted energy and engaging in flare mitigation is a better means to lowering emissions versus capping energy production, Crusoe’s Lochmiller said. The company lists Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Devon Energy as a customer that has pledged to reach flaring intensity of 0.5% or lower by 2025, and eliminate routine flaring by 2030.Global oil demand fell nearly 7% in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and flaring fell by only 5%, the IEA notes. Globally, 142 billion cubic meters of natural gas was flared in 2020 – roughly equivalent to the natural gas demand of Central and South America. That amount of flaring resulted in about 265 metric tons of carbon dioxide, nearly 8 metric tons of methane (240 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent) and black soot, along with other greenhouse gases being directly emitted into the atmosphere.“To reduce flaring, productive uses for the associated gas must be developed, or associated gas must be safely injected into the reservoir,” according to the IEA, adding in its flaring outlook that “one solution is to channel associated gas into the main gas grid to meet local demand or to be exported.”Scalability of bitcoin miningDespite superficial differences, fundamentally there are many aspects of bitcoin mining that an energy producer will find familiar, according to Leachman. “One of the similarities is that the low-cost providers, or the low-cost operators, are going to be the ones that will have the staying power,’’ he said.For a bitcoin miner, access to cheap power is essential to stay competitive. If natural gas that was going to waste can be turned into power for mining, electricity would be essentially free for the energy company’s mining operations, while adding a revenue stream.Oil and gas producers, along with providers of infrastructure, like pipelines, “really have the potential to have a very asymmetrical risk profile to bitcoin mining,” Leachman said.These energy companies already have a sustainable business, and if they dedicate a portion of their capital to bitcoin mining, it can almost act like a hedge for their main revenue stream during a down cycle for commodities, he explained. An additional aspect of bitcoin mining that’s attractive compared to oil and gas production is that crypto mining is “completely scalable,” Leachman said.Energy producers face hurdles in ramping up production, whereas bitcoin miners can generate revenue quicker once they are up and running and eventually are able to increase the scale of their operations at a faster rate.Digital storage for natural gasTo be clear: Leachman isn’t saying all oil and gas companies will completely pivot to bitcoin mining.“My recommendation for oil and gas companies wouldn’t be to necessarily have the goal to become the biggest bitcoin miner,” but rather to treat bitcoin mining as a secondary business that supplements their core business, he said.Another part of Leachman’s pitch for bitcoin mining exposure is that it can act as digital storage, in a sense, for an energy company’s natural gas and provide better returns during periods of volatile commodity price fluctuations in traditional gas production.Energy companies can convert their gases to bitcoin, hold the cryptocurrency digitally and participate in the upside as bitcoin prices appreciate in the future, he said.By using the excess energy to mine bitcoin, “there is a chance that the small percentage that you dedicated to bitcoin mining could be worth significantly more than the gas that you traditionally would sell down the line,” he said.Utility companies as bitcoin minersBeyond oil and gas operations, utility companies can also explore bitcoin mining given their experience with power grids and storing energy, Leachman said.Julien Dumoulin-Smith, a Bank of America research analyst, said in a note to clients that shared with CoinDesk that “unregulated independent power producers (IPPs) have the greatest opportunity to partner with miners and we have already seen agreements announced.”Dumoulin-Smith highlighted utility Black Hills Corp. as the perfect example of such a business model. The company “appears to have the most exposure because of its Wyoming footprint and innovative Block Chain Interruptible Service (BCIS) tariff,” the Bank of America note said. Black Hills developed the BCIS to meet energy needs of cryptocurrency miners, including fixed cost per kilowatt-hour rates, and negotiated prices that remain fixed for a period of two to three years.Another source of allure for companies in energy or other unrelated industries is that profit margins for bitcoin miners are now as high as 90%.","November 22, 2021, 8:27 AM"

The DeFi market is still largely unregulated and has gained the reputation as the Wild West of crypto. A new research report by crypto risk management firm Elliptic illustrates some of the pitfalls associated with the market.Losses stemming from DeFi-related fraud and theft total $10.5 billion year-to-date. This amount is up an eye-popping 600% vs. 2020 levels of $1.5 billion. Last year, DeFi ended the year with $21.1 billion in TVL, according to DeFi Llama.In a more top level view, DeFi market participants lost slightly more than $12 billion so far this year overall due to “the malicious exploitation of flaws” across Dapps including “decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols and asset management offerings,” according to the announcement.Elliptic Chief Scientist Tom Robinson stated,“The DeFi ecosystem is an incredibly exciting and fast-moving space, with financial services innovation happening at light speed. This is attracting large amounts of capital to projects that are not always robust or well-tested. Criminal actors have seen the opportunity to exploit this.”DeFi CulpritsAccording to the report, the culprits have been flaws in Dapps, giving nefarious actors the opportunity to exploit bugs. While decentralized apps are designed to be trustless and not require the intervention of any centralized third party, this does little good when the code has vulnerabilities.Flawed Dapps represented $10.8 billion of the loss tally. In addition, rug pulls, or exit scams, have also been on the rise in DeFi and have tacked on another $1 billion to this year’s losses.Burgeoning MarketDespite the risks, DeFi continues to attract top-tier developers and high-net-worth investors. DeFi has already disrupted the traditional financial system, giving market participants the opportunity to generate returns from activities such as lending and borrowing, staking and yield farming.Story continuesThe Bitwise management team forecasts that DeFi has only scratched the surface. They say DeFi could balloon into a $15 trillion segment in the next five-15 years if it follows in the footsteps of other disruptive technologies in which the Teslas and Amazons of the world operate.Ethereum, which is the most popular platform for DeFi projects, currently boasts $172.5 billion in TVL and rising. The Ethereum price has been on a tear in 2021 alongside the rise of DeFi.The Ethereum blockchain is home to popular DeFi projects such as MakerDAO for crypto lending and borrowing, exchange liquidity pool Curve Finance, and Compound, to name a few.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Dogecoin (DOGE) Attempts To Sustain Buying Interest Above $0.22TIME Magazine Adds ETH To Its Balance Sheet, Joins MetaverseNFL’s OBJ Joins Growing List of Players to Be Paid in BitcoinNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Slip on Warm Weather ForecastUSD/CAD Daily Forecast – Test Of Resistance At 1.2675S&P 500 Price Forecast – S&P 500 Reaches All-Time Highs","November 22, 2021, 8:51 AM"

As such, the concept of prime brokerage in traditional finance – a bundle of services often offered by investment banks that includes lending, cash management and netting – is gradually being replicated in the cryptocurrency world.Algorand buildersFounded by the Rand Labs team that built Algorand staples My Algo Wallet and AlgoExplorer, C3 is focused on creating a new layer for using collateral and margin across different blockchains, starting out by connecting collateral management Algorand and Ethereum, with the same cross-chain functionality also coming to Algrand and Solana.“The way Ethereum DeFi was built, every team tackled a separate vertical such as lending and borrowing, perpetuals or DEXs [decentralized exchanges],” C3 founder Michel Dahdah said in an interview. “But having all these different financial products isolated in terms of how they manage collateral makes it impossible for them to cross margin, meaning the collateral you’re using to borrow money for shorting, for example, can’t be used to also open a long position in a perpetuals financial product.”C3 will operate a “global clearing engine,” Dahdah said, so that users can lock collateral in one place and use it across a range of positions, in the same way that prime brokers act as a hub for collateral management in traditional finance.“C3 is an ambitious idea. It bridges the gap between TradFi and DeFi trading by completely rethinking how we manage collateral across both blockchains and DeFi protocols,” Ninos Mansor, partner at Arrington Capital, said in a statement. “They are taking on one of the biggest challenges in all of DeFi, a pain point that will continue to grow as DeFi becomes increasingly multi-chain.”Read more: Algorand Boosts Smart Contract Performance With ‘Virtual Machine’ Launch","November 22, 2021, 9:00 AM"

However, under the firebrand leadership of controversial Jair Bolsonaro, cryptocurrency adoption has slowed with the president infamously declaring “I don’t know what Bitcoin is”.But, as in many other environments worldwide, the decentralised revolution is grassroots in nature and adoption is fuelled not by the permissions of policymakers but by the everyday people that choose to use it.And one thing is crystal clear – Brazilians are choosing Bitcoin.It is estimated that 5% of Brazil’s entire population now own cryptocurrency – in excess of 10 million people.This impressive figure allows Brazil to boast the fifth-biggest crypto community in the world, with demographic research showing that holders are largely male and under the age of 40.Bitcoin popularity in Brazil driving adoptionHowever, not all of the state machinery is asleep – BACEN and Banco do Brasil are awake to the revolution in their doorstep.Despite the dismissive stance of Bolsonaro, the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN) officially recognised Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as monetary assets in 2019, and Banco do Brasil became the first state bank in the world to enable consumer exposure to Bitcoin through ETF products – a huge move for the industry earlier this year.The mass adoption and excitement around Bitcoin since the onset of the 2021 bull run has now landed cryptocurrencies firmly on the desks on Brazil’s legislators – with a legislative bill underway that aims to give Bitcoin full legal tender status, similar to El Salvador.Story continuesThere was also the recent passage of amendments that brought in stricter punishments for crypto fraudsters and cyber criminals.Brazil’s crypto economy is also benefiting from the Bitcoin boom – the Brazilian-based Mercado Bitcoin, has succeeded in raising $200m in its recent Series B funding round.This investment in Mercado Bitcoin made 2TM (Mercado’s parent company) the eighth most valuable ‘unicorn’ company in South America.Read more: Brazil sports betting market to be worth $1.6bn annually.","November 22, 2021, 9:08 AM"

I think they're right. But I'm not betting the farm on it.I was an internet-stock analyst during the dot-com bubble two decades ago, so I have some firsthand experience with financial bubbles. I've summarized the experience here, along with my subsequent run-in with the SEC.In a future article, I'll explain why I'm in the bubble camp. But here, I'll just share three things I learned last time that explain why I'm not going all-in in either direction this time around.1. No one knows what will happen, including your favorite market gurus.Back in the 1990s, I got to know some of the most sophisticated professional investors in the world. As I talked with them, and learned from them, I realized that one of my long-held assumptions about Wall Street was wrong.I had assumed that, somewhere, there were some investors who were so smart and well-informed that they knew what was going to happen.Instead, I learned that no one knows what is going to happen.Some investors' guesses are more sophisticated and better informed and reasoned than others, but they're still guesses. No one actually knows.Why does this matter?It matters because it's important to remind yourself that your favorite market gurus don't know what will happen. Not George Soros. Not Warren Buffett. Not Ray Dalio. Not your crypto-zealot buddy or your trusted financial advisor. So don't put too much stock in what anyone says or thinks will happen. They don't know.2. It's really hard to ""call the top.""It's always tempting to think you can ride the market up, ""call the top,"" and then get out before the crash.Story continuesAlas, this is harder than it looks.(Also, unless you never plan to invest again, you have to also correctly ""call the bottom,"" so you can get back in. And you have to pay taxes on any gains you accrued on the way up. So to make it worth selling out, you have to get the timing right twice and make more than the 25%-to-50% tax hit on your gains. That's hard.)From 1995 to 2000, I thought what was happening with tech and internet stocks might be a bubble, and I was on the lookout for ""the top.""The problem is that, except in hindsight, it's hard to tell the difference between ""a dip"" and ""the top.""From 1995 to 1999, everything that looked like it might be ""the top"" — including a big, scary ""dip"" in the fall of 1998 — proved to be just another ""buying opportunity.""By early 2000, things had been crazy for years, and, despite the occasional dip, they had just kept getting crazier. So even in March 2000, when the Nasdaq fell by a third in three weeks, most of us didn't know we had passed ""the top.""The market rallied that summer. By fall, we were almost back to the previous highs. It wasn't until then that the bottom fell out.In hindsight, the cause of the top was obvious: The source of cash that had accelerated spending on all manner of tech and internet products for years — wide-open IPO and debt markets that allowed anyone who wanted money to raise as much as they wanted — disappeared. And the spending disappeared with it.Unfortunately, to most of us, this was only obvious in hindsight.(You may think I only missed the top in 2000 because I'm an idiot. That may be so, but please read this excellent WSJ article by Greg Zuckerman describing how one of the smartest investors in history, Stan Druckenmiller, also missed it. Druckenmiller is not an idiot.)3. It's almost as painful to miss out on crazy gains as it is to lose your shirt. (Almost.)One thing everyone forgets after a bubble bursts is how painful it is to miss out when everything is going up.It's really painful.Just ask anyone who sold Tesla five years ago. Or who never bought bitcoin. Or who jettisoned everything in the depths of the Great Financial Crisis. Or who got spooked during last year's COVID crash and missed the extraordinary rally since.Almost nothing hurts more than that.Almost nothing... except one thing:Losing your shirt when the bubble bursts.That REALLY hurts.So how do I invest my own money when I think it's a bubble but I know I don't know; when I don't think I can ""call the top and then call the bottom""; and when it hurts almost as much to miss out on gains as to lose my shirt?I stay diversified.Unlike professional investors, my job doesn't depend on my outperforming competitors every week. This gives me the flexibility to avoid betting money on things I don't know and can't control.If the market is a bubble, I'll take it on the chin. But I'll live to fight another day.If it's not a bubble and it just keeps soaring higher, I'll make less than those who bet the ranch, but I won't miss out completely.This approach may sound boring, unambitious, and wimpy. But if you like to sleep well — and not waste time worrying about things you don't know and can't control — I recommend it.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 22, 2021, 9:22 AM"

""Invest here and earn all the money you want,"" he told the euphoric crowd.Supporters have hailed Bukele's plans - including making bitcoin legal tender in September - saying they would bring jobs, financial inclusion and foreign investment to one of the Western Hemisphere's poorest countries.""Feel the Bit"" read the giant screen before Bukele - who brands himself ""CEO of El Salvador"" on Twitter - came on stage.But some in El Salvador and beyond expressed outrage at the glitzy event in a nation beleaguered by inequality, violence and poor public services.""This video makes me sick, angry and sad at the same time,"" said Marce, twitter user @_lamismadeayer.The government says the issuance of $1 billion in ""Volcano bonds"" in partnership with Blockstream - a digital assets infrastructure company - would provide development funds. El Salvador currently faces a $500 million budget gap for next year according to credit rating agency Fitch.But the bitcoin bond is not designed to cover that gap.Half of the bond money would go to infrastructure, including for building Bitcoin City, with the remainder used to purchase bitcoin and locked up for five years. After the lock up, the bitcoin can be sold, generating a capital return that will be split 50-50 between the government and investors, only after the initial $500 million are recouped, according to the plan.Story continuesThe 10-year bitcoin bond offers a 6.5% coupon, payable yearly, but another Salvadoran bond that matures in 2032 is currently yielding close to 13.9%.Financial markets have reacted warily. The spread of Salvadoran yields to safe-haven U.S. Treasuries has widened sharply since late April. This week it added an extra 79 basis points and sits above 1,200 bps, its widest ever.Investors sold off El Salvador's bonds in May after the Bukele-controlled Congress fired the attorney general and five Supreme Court judges, who were replaced with loyalists, critics say.The 2025 bond yields more than 18%, according to Refinitiv data. With such a high cost, the country is effectively excluded from borrowing on the market.Graham Stock, senior sovereign analyst at Blue Bat Asset Management, said government funding through bitcoin could discourage El Salvador from adopting sustainable spending policies, adding the country would likely continue to need International Monetary Fund support.""Building the economy around crypto mining and attracting crypto businesses is an untested strategy to put it mildly,"" he said, adding Bukele did not appear to have plans to increase growth and tax revenues. IMF TALKS STALLEDTalks with the IMF for a $1 billion loan have stalled amid concerns over a lack of transparency and the price volatility of cryptocurrency, as well as fears of democratic backsliding as Bukele consolidates power. But many in the cryptocurrency community are upbeat, saying the bond will harness strong retail demand.""Bitcoin bonds are a game-changer in fixed income markets,” said Moritz Wietersheim, founder of Specter Solutions, a bitcoin security and product company.Although bitcoin has fallen about 16% from its record high of $68,990.90 this month, it remains up over 90% this year.""Bitcoin Week"" marked the first time the digital currency experiment was stress-tested by international crypto evangelists.As vendors hawked ""Jesus Loves Bitcoin"" shirts, panel discussions grouped crypto currency leaders and Salvadoran ministers. Excitement was widespread at having a 'petri dish', as many attendees called El Salvador’s experiment.Several attendees aired worries about the government's Chivo wallet, where Salvadorans can send and receive bitcoin - highlighting tensions over a state tool for a currency created as an alternative to government financial systems.Pre-loaded with $30 for users and backed by a $150 million fund, Chivo allows users to make transactions to other Chivo users fee-free, but registration requires Salvadorans to enter their ID numbers and other personal information while transactions are kept on a ledger.Some attendees described Chivo as a gateway to independent bitcoin wallets, such as Muun or BlueWallet, that offer privacy.""When I make a payment, in the notes section, I write ‘use Muun, don’t use Chivo,’"" said Wietersheim, using the hashtag #FixChivo on Twitter.Since its rollout, Chivo has been criticized for thousands of cases of fraud and money disappearing from wallets.Several programmers said that for the speed of implementation - less than four months after Bukele announced it at a June conference - these technical problems were normal.Bukele has blamed high demand for the issues.

48,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/junk-rated-el-salvador-bitcoin-174520282.html,Junk-Rated El Salvador’s ‘Bitcoin Bonds’ Look Explosive (Think Volcano),"While El Salvador’s new bitcoin-linked bond may be one of the highest-yielding fixed-income instruments globally, it might turn out to be riskier than the country’s outstanding government bonds, which are already categorized as junk-grade.Some experts said the new offering might struggle to attract investors, especially since the bond appears to pay interest at a lower rate than the country’s conventional dollar-denominated bonds.El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele announced the plans on Saturday to issue a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” with a 10-year maturity on the Liquid Network. Half of the money raised will be used to purchase bitcoin, and the rest will fund construction of a new ”Bitcoin City,” along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano.The bond – developed by Blockstream and processed by Bitfinex – will offer a 6.5% coupon, or the rate of annual interest payments. In addition, investors will receive dividends generated by staggered liquidation of bitcoin holdings, which will begin from the sixth year. The annualized yield back to investors could reach 146% in the 10th year, according to Blockstream projections.Compare that with the benchmark 10-year yield on El Salvador’s outstanding government bonds, currently around 13%, according to Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International (ADMISI).For further context, the U.S. 10-year Treasury, considered by many global authorities and bond investors to have pristine creditworthiness, yields about 1.5%.Will the bitcoin price go to $1 million?But the new El Salvador bond’s projected performance is based on Blockstream models suggesting that bitcoin will rally to $1 million in the next five years – an aggressive target given that the cryptocurrency is currently trading around $58,000.Some investors might be betting that the lockup period – wherein $500 million of bitcoin would be out of circulation – might itself contribute to a fresh bull run.Story continues“Anyone buying this bitcoin-backed bond is betting on the cryptocurrency in a very big way, ignoring the credit market currently signaling that El Salvador is very much facing a distressed-debt situation,” Ostwald told CoinDesk in an email.Prices for the country’s outstanding government bonds due in 2032 traded above 110 cents on the dollar in April – well above the par value – and have been declining ever since. Recently, they were changing hands below 75 cents on the dollar, providing a very relevant example of just how volatile emerging-market bonds can be.El Salvador’s bonds considered junk-gradeCredit-rating firms have already cast the Central American country’s bitcoin foray as a negative.El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender in June. A month later, Moody’s downgraded the country’s long-term, foreign-currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Caa1 from B3, citing the decision to adopt bitcoin as a sign of weak governance. Obligations rated Caa1 are judged to be junk grade – of poor standing and subject to very high credit risk.The latest announcement to issue bitcoin-backed bonds may draw further ire from rating agencies and international partners.“I suspect that El Salvador bonds are sufficiently risky, and adding bitcoin on top of that precludes most retail investors and more institutional investors,” Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, told CoinDesk in an email.Charlie Morris, CIO of ByteTree Asset Management, said issuing bonds linked to bitcoin could further isolate El Salvador.“That is dangerous because if the plan goes wrong, who will save the day?” Morris said, adding that Blockstream’s million-dollar forecast for bitcoin (BTC) is extremely optimistic.Are El Salvador’s bitcoin bonds a gimmick?According to Bannockburn’s Chandler, the country’s new bitcoin bonds appear to be a gimmick to achieve lower interest rates.Borrowing costs tend to be higher in indebted nations with weak economic growth like El Salvador, Greece, Sri Lanka, and Mozambique. Each of these nations offers a double-digit yield on their benchmark 10-year bond.However, by allocating half of the proceeds from the debt sale to bitcoin, the El Salvadorian government is giving investors a share of the cryptocurrency’s possible price upside. That might help explain why investors would be willing to buy the country’s new bitcoin bonds at a lower yield than what they would get from El Salvador’s conventional outstanding bonds.According to Chandler, “the desperate attempt” could work but would require getting lucky on bitcoin, whose intrinsic value, or lack thereof, continues to be debated. Chandler says that other countries should follow El Salvador’s lead but probably won’t.“I doubt that as I doubted many corporate treasurers would buy bitcoins as Tesla did,” he said.Would it be less risky to... just buy bitcoin?Crypto investors may also think twice before taking the gambit, since they likely already have experience buying bitcoin directly.“While crypto enthusiasts will doubtless be buyers, the simple question is would they rather own the underlying, or be happy to take the encumbrance of a clearly distressed sovereign debt, let alone any geological risk of ‘Bitcoin City’ being located next to a volcano,” ADMISI’s Ostwald said. “I guess that brings a whole new meaning to ‘explosive.’”Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETF expert and director of CEC Capital, said the bitcoin-backed bonds might be a good deal for investors who are already motivated to buy emerging market debt – government bonds of Russia, Mexico, India, Brazil and other less-developed nations. The benchmark bonds in these nations yield between 6% to 9%.However, for more risk-averse crypto traders, holding bitcoin might be a better option – as outlandish as that might sound to some investors used to lower volatility in traditional markets.“It is safer and may appreciate more than the bond,” Kssis said. “Bear in mind that the bond could/may default and may be classified as junk status so many investors may not be able to invest.”","November 22, 2021, 9:45 AM"

ADA crypto is now down over 29 cents in the past month, as of Nov. 21, when it was at $1.87 per token. That is a drop of 13.5%.Cardano (ADA) token with blue and orange digital background.Source: Stanslavs / ShutterstockMoreover, in the last 3 months, it peaked at $2.9634 on Sept. 1. This represents a tumble of over $1.09 per ADA crypto token or a loss of 36.9%.This is a much worse performance than other cryptos its size or larger. For example, Solana (CCC:SOL-USD), which is slightly larger, has risen 19.1% in the past month, not dropped like Cardano. Solana now has a market capitalization of $71 billion, but Cardano is at just $62.2 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, by comparison, Solana is up 222% in the past three months, not down 37% like at Cardano. Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up over 10% in the last month, and in the last 3 months, it’s up over 35%. This puts Cardano’s 37% drop in the same period to shame.In fact, Binance Coin (CCC:BNB-USD), which has a $99 billion market cap, is up in both its one-month and 3-month performance. It’s up over 25.3% in the last month and up 30.6% in the last 3 months.7 Stocks to Sell You Can Feel Good About DumpingThe same is true for Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Although being down 5.3% in the last month, it’s still up 21.1% in the last 3 months, not down like Cardano.This Should Tell You SomethingSo Cardano is the odd man out. It should imply something significant. I have written about the issues with Cardano in several other articles.One of my concerns is that Cardano’s smart contract upgrade has not taken off that well. So far the Alonzo hard fork, or upgrade, has not yet shown to have brought in a good number of new apps.For example, developers have not yet taken up the Cardano script en masse, so to speak, to write smart contract apps in the Defi arena (decentralized finance). Nor is there a major NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace that has taken up a large market share with trading in NFTs.Story continuesIt’s not that I don’t think this will come sometime in the future. At least right now, Cardano’s smart contract upgrade capabilities have yet to catch on with new games, DeFi apps, NFTs, etc.And as I have shown the crypto simply does not have a large market share in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL). To put it bluntly, Cardano simply has no TVL market share, according to DefiLlama.com, which doesn’t even rank Cardano-based apps.What this tells me, along with the drop in ADA crypto price, is that Cardano is on its backfoot. It needs to book a major win, a major app or sponsor, company or personality backing its ongoing development.What to Do With ADA CryptoAt this point, despite being near a trough, it might make sense for value crypto buyers to wait out the weakness in the price. It’s always possible this extra volatility — compared to other cryptos its size — is indicative of another leg down.The torrent of bearish sentiment sometimes feeds on itself. For example, it’s hard to get people to believe in a turnaround without any major news. In fact, when the Alonzo hard fork came out in September, Decrypt magazine quoted a number of critics on Cardano. Some of them “cast doubt on whether Cardano’s smart contract models are up to the task.” The article mentioned that Cardano’s script needs a number of “workarounds.”I suspect that most investors will hold off putting new money into ADA crypto until Cardano smart contracts start to win big support. That seems like a winning formula in the cryptocurrency arena, which has many cryptos spending large amounts on marketing and technology. So far I don’t see that happening with Cardano.On the date of publication, Mark R. Hake did not hold any position, directly or indirectly, in any security mentioned in this article.

In fact, early in March, TIME released an exclusive series of three TIME covers as NFTs at auction, which featured iconic covers through its tenure and also a special design for the purpose.Expanding Crypto Offering Soon?About the metaverse’s category, TIME will run the campaign through December 31, while the weekly newsletter will last indefinitely. The maneuver is another milestone for the company in terms of crypto adoption, given that the partnership with Galaxy Digital is a big one.The crypto firm is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as GLXY and specializes in portfolio management, capital markets, and blockchain technology. It also has offices in several major cities like New York, Tokyo, Amsterdam, London, among others.It’s unknown whether the media outlet expects to expand its metaverse section into other crypto-related fronts or not, nor will it diversify the crypto offering among its subscribersHowever, TIME is setting precedents in the US mainstream media as a crypto-friendly outlet that paves the ground for others to become familiar with an industry that gathers more adopters from an institutional level each day.

A recent rally shot shiba inu to the 11th spot among the world's most valuable cryptocurrencies, a position that has since slipped slightly, to 12th place, according to CoinGecko.Dogecoin came in second on the list of price increases at 9,567% growth this year.""Envisaged as being a light-hearted and fun cryptocurrency to poke fun at the emerging world of crypto, [dogecoin] ended up building its own community and taking off in a huge way, particularly after being frequently mentioned by Elon Musk on social media,"" said BrokerChooser, noting the Tesla boss has said dogecoin is part of his personal portfolio.Story continuesBehind dogecoin was Terra, which trades as LUNA, with its price jump of 6,496% to $31.66 in September. The token, developed by South Korean firm Terraform Labs, is used for governance and staking on a decentralized financial payment network that powers a basket of stablecoins for cross-border transactions.Terra's price ""exploded"" in January when it raised $25 million in a funding round from Galaxy Digital, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, and others, said BrokerChooser.Shiba Inu led in the number of searches, with ""Shiba Inu coin"" soaring to 1.5 million searches from 70. Searches began to increase despite the coin's ""incredibly low"" price of $0.0000000003 in September 2020 that eventually drove up to $0.0000072 a year later.

A Canada-based company called Westblock was recruiting “labor hands,” in Nelson’s words, to help unload boxes in a data center facility on land belonging to the Navajo Nation.A Navajo living on tribe land, Nelson considered the job rare for its proximity to her home. With a total tribe population of 400,000 people, only about 170,000 live on the reservation. That’s most often attributed to poor economic conditions and scarce employment opportunities, especially for women.While grateful for the opportunity, Nelson’s employer didn’t initially tell her what the company’s business on the New Mexico reservation was.Another Navajo woman, Kennette Phillips, who was hired around the same time, recalled similar misgivings surrounding the mysterious business of her employer.As security guards kept watch over the site, Phillips, Nelson and another employee unloaded boxes and then began setting up the machines inside.“When we opened the boxes, we found these machines that looked like toasters,” Phillips recalled. “We weren’t told what they were for. It seemed a little sketchy… we didn’t know if what we were doing was legal.”Tiffany Nelson (Photo courtesy of Compass Mining)Part of their growing concern was spurred by the crisis-level rates indigenous women have been kidnapped or murdered across Canada and the U.S. When the two women, both single mothers, finally asked their employer what the site would be used for, they discovered with much relief, the company intended to use the toaster-like machines to mine bitcoin.Bitcoin mining is the computationally-heavy process of computers validating bitcoin’s network of transactions. While the cryptocurrency’s supply is limited at 21 million coins, it distributes a small sliver of that supply to miners for contributing computer power, thereby securing the network.The work can be lucrative, especially as the price has more than tripled over the last year. Mining bitcoin requires specialized computers, the infrastructure to house them, plus a robust and stable power supply.Story continues“Oh, wow. Okay,” Nelson remembered thinking with relief. She didn’t claim to understand the full extent of how bitcoin worked back then, but she knew it was a cryptocurrency, “like internet money.”Three years later, Nelson and Phillips manage operations for the site full-time. In addition to two other full-time managers who together keep the operation running day and night, the facility also employs four to six security guards to protect their expensive mining equipment, which is valued in the tens of millions of dollars, according to WestBlock’s CEO Ken MacLean.Tapping into unused power sourcesLike many other bitcoin mining operations, this project benefits from tapping into energy that otherwise went unused. After the shutdown of a nearby coal-fired power plant, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority (NTUA), a tribe-owned nonprofit, possessed an extra 15-megawatt load of electricity for which they were eating the cost.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.According to WestBlock’s MacLean, the power the operation draws from NTUA comes from a mix of solar, hydroelectric, nuclear power and natural gas, with 60% of it attributed to renewable energy. The situation reflects the Navajo Nation’s broader and economically difficult energy transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources over the last decade.Historically, the bulk of the tribe’s revenues have come from leasing land to extractive energy companies, with leases for oil and gas mining operations accounting for 51% of the tribe’s total income as far back as 2003.Critics of bitcoin mining’s high energy consumption are quick to point out that bitcoin now accounts for 1% of the planet’s energy consumption. While direct comparison can be tricky, the computational power directed toward securing bitcoin consumes more power than all the refrigerators in the U.S. but less than the total energy used to produce paper and pulp worldwide, according to the University of Cambridge’s Center for Alternative Finance. Additionally, WestBlock’s bitcoin mining project currently uses 7 megawatts of the NTUA’s power with plans to eventually use all 15 megawatts in the near future. Relative to other regions within the Navajo Nation, the project’s energy consumption suggests some economic disparity.A three-hour drive west from the site, in the Nation’s Black Mesa region, many residents live without electricity and running water.Kennette Phillips (Photo courtesy of Compass Mining)Navajo Nation's need to diversify its economyBut the effort of transferring power from one part of the nation to another is not so simple, according to Carl Slater, a delegate with the Navajo Nation’s Tribal Council. Roughly the size of West Virginia, the Navajo Nation is the largest independent authority of land within the U.S. and its power grid isn't connected evenly dispersed or connected throughout its 17 million square acres.Surprised, to say the least, when he first heard a developer was mining bitcoin on Navajo land, Slater told Yahoo Finance the opportunity could be an economic boon for the nation, if the revenues paid to its utility can end up serving the nation's residents.“The utility that the nation owns would have just had to eat the cost of that power. To make use of it in a way that generates revenue back to the nation is good, but I think there’s a shared responsibility between the nation, utility and developer to figure out a process whereby more of the revenue can be directed to our local communities,” said Slater.Andrew Curley, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Arizona, said the Nation’s move to bitcoin mining is just the latest iteration of their long-standing need to diversify its economy.“The tribal leaders are trying to make the reservation a place where companies, outside of those in extractive industries, can do business and hire people,” said Curley, a Navajo Nation member himself, who lives off the reservation.A sociologist by training whose research focuses on the Navajo Nation's energy transition, Curley called the bitcoin mining project an “interesting prospect” but also acknowledged that the Nation's energy disparity is relative to different local communities. While some communities remain without power, he said the utility companies bare the brunt of the responsibility, explaining that overall, the Navajo Nation “by far under-consumes the amount of energy it produces.” When thinking of other economically struggling nations that have or are considering adopting cryptocurrency more broadly, such as El Salvador, Curley is quick to point out the obvious problem with making cryptocurrency play a larger rule in the Nation's economy.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.“There is an innate problem and challenge when asking poorer people to take riskier transfers of technology,” said Curly.Though WestBlock’s mining operation opened in 2020, this year marks the first time the project has gained a material profit. On the other hand, the tribal utility NTUA has yet to disclose its total revenue from the effort, but should in early 2022. In addition to monthly revenues for internet and electricity paid to the NTUA, WestBlock also pays taxes, rent for its land lease in addition to scholarships set aside for the local community.A person familiar with the Navajo-based operation said the revenue generated from the project this year is “in the millions,"" and that WestBlock is working with NTUA along with other tribal chapters to find other sites on the land, which might be used for bitcoin mining.“I’m just happy to have a job close to home, especially since so many people lost their jobs during the pandemic,” Tiffany Nelson added. “It's been a good ride and something that I’m proud to be a part of.”David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

The country’s top taxman said that cryptocurrencies could be used to evade taxes, and that would erode the profits on taxation.In a recent interview, Egorov stated that “We are watching this market closely and understand that this payment system can significantly erode the taxation base.” He added that the tax authority would approach the problem in a systematic way but didn’t provide specific details.Furthermore, Egorov added that the Federal Tax Service has been using blockchain technology to store electronic power of attorney letters.

There’s no question about it.”O’Leary pegged the opportunity in the “billions and billions and billions” of dollars.That said, O’Leary’s biggest investment fund, O’Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, doesn’t invest in crypto at all — instead, it seeks businesses with strong profitability, balance sheets, and dividend growth.While Bitcoin is certainly becoming mainstream, it’s still important to maintain ample diversification with income-producing stocks.Let’s take a look at the top three holdings of O’Leary’s flagship fund. One (or all) of these dividend picks might be worth purchasing with your extra change.Home DepotSundry Photography/ShutterstockHome Depot isn’t nearly as exciting as crypto, but it’s the top holding at OUSA, accounting for 6% of the fund’s weight.The home improvement retail giant has around 2,300 stores, with each one averaging approximately 105,000 square feet of indoor retail space — a size that dwarfs most of its competitors.One thing that makes Home Depot stand out is how well it performed during the pandemic.Many brick-and-mortar retailers have struggled since the beginning of COVID-19. Yet Home Depot grew its sales nearly 20% in fiscal 2020 to $132.1 billion.It even boosted its quarterly dividend by 10% earlier this year and now yields 1.6%.Shares aren’t cheap, though.After rallying more than 55% year to date, Home Depot trades at over $410 per share. But you can get a piece of the company using a popular stock trading app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.Story continuesMicrosoftVolodymyr Kyrylyuk/ShutterstockTech stocks aren’t known for their dividends, but software gorilla Microsoft is an exception.The company announced an 11% increase to its quarterly dividend to 62 cents per share a few months ago. Over the past five years, its payout has grown by 59%.So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Microsoft is the second-largest holding in O’Leary’s OUSA.Business has been booming of late, largely helped by the pandemic-fueled demand for its cloud-computing and video gaming offerings.In the most recent quarter, Microsoft's total revenue grew 22% to $45.3 billion while net income surged 48% to $20.5 billion.Year to date, Microsoft shares have returned a whopping 55%, easily topping other trillion-dollar tech giants like Apple (22%) and Amazon (13%).Of course, if you’re on the fence about jumping into tech stocks near all-time highs, some investing apps might give you a free share of Apple just for signing up.Johnson & JohnsonGolden Shrimp/ShutterstockWith deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, Johnson & Johnson has been able to deliver remarkably consistent returns to investors through thick and thin.Not only does Johnson & Johnson post recurring profits year in and year out, but it grows them consistently, as well: Over the last 20 years, Johnson & Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.That said, management is shaking things up to extract even more value for shareholders.The company recently announced plans to spin off its consumer health segment into a separate company in order to unlock value. Once the split is complete, investors will be given shares in both companies and, in turn, receive dividend payments from both stocks.With the spinoff looming and the shares currently offering a decent dividend yield of 2.6%, Johnson & Johnson looks like a particularly timely opportunity.The company is the third-largest holding in OUSA with a weighting of 4.7%.O’Leary’s other ‘fine’ assetGiorgiolo/ShutterstockGold, crypto, and common stocks aren’t the only things you’ll find in Mr. Wonderful’s portfolio.He also utilizes a ""private"" way to diversify and to profit.If you want to invest in something that has very little correlation with the violent swings of the stock and crypto market, consider this overlooked asset: fine art.Investing in art used to be an option only for the ultra-rich like O’Leary. But with a new investing platform, you can take a stake in it, too.According to the Citi Global Art Market chart, contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:Market moves: Bitcoin broke above $59,000 with at least one analyst expecting a “healthy” holiday rally.Technician’s take (Editor’s Note): On account of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, today’s First Mover Asia will include a column in place of the usual Technician’s take.Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.PricesBitcoin (BTC): $59,118 +3.5%Ether (ETH): $4,530 +6.4%Market movesThe crypto market on Thursday, the U.S. Thanksgiving day holiday, was not as quiet as some may have anticipated, after bitcoin prices briefly broke past $59,000, and trading volume remained at a level similar to the previous three days. Ether soared past $4,500, a more than 6% gain.Credit: CoinDesk/CryptoCompareAs bitcoin’s price finished Thursday (HKT/SGT) in the green, the rest of the crypto market experienced high price volatility with major winners of the day including gaming tokens GALA, SAND, and MANA and dog-themed meme token SHIB. These tokens all saw high daily trading volume on Thursday, a bullish sign for a token’s price when it accompanies a price rally.One analyst expects this bullish sentiment will continue during the December holiday season, particularly now that a few macroeconomic uncertainties have abated, including Jerome Powell’s reappointment as Federal Reserve chair.“The period after U.S. Thanksgiving is traditionally very bullish for risky assets and I would not be surprised to see a healthy Christmas rally for cryptos during the holiday season,” Changguang Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, told CoinDesk.Yet there were also less optimistic signs in investors’ activities. “Bitcoin put options, derivatives offering downside protection, continue to become pricier, implying bearish sentiment,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported on Thursday.OpinionEl Salvador: Who Needs the IMF When You Have Bitcoin?: The IMF is a brutal bully constantly declaring its virtue. It’s about time someone pushed back.Story continuesChristopher Nolan’s third Batman film, “The Dark Knight Rises,” is generally considered the weakest entry in the series, in part because it’s so easily read as a celebration of neoliberal authoritarianism. The film’s plot has the villain, Bane, take over Gotham City, wipe out all financial ledgers and reign over a kind of mega-Occupy movement. To fight back, Batman engages in a series of moral compromises that he justifies as, more or less, necessary exceptions to defend a more broadly just system.The International Monetary Fund has been playing the Batman role in the global order for decades. Though nominally aimed at supporting democracy and free markets, reforms mandated by the IMF in exchange for its loans have historically included serious cuts to social spending and industrial policy. The fallout is often devastating: The IMF’s (real world) body count is considerably higher than Batman’s.El Salvador, a country with low income and high debt, has been in negotiations with the IMF for one of its loans in the amount of $1.3 billion. One roadblock has been the country’s recent adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF signaled it wasn’t too happy with that idea.On Monday, El Salvador introduced a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” that could present at least a partial end-run around the IMF, highlighting why bitcoin made the IMF so queasy in the first place. “The Dark Knight Rises” contains a notorious moment, drawn from the Batman comics, in which Bane pummels Batman so badly that his back is broken, leaving him paralyzed and vulnerable. That’s about how the IMF is going to feel if El Salvador finds a way to raise large sums of international financing, as a developing country with a troubled economy, without the IMF or corruption-riddled global banks.The bond allows purchases in units of $100, using bitcoin or tether. It will be issued by Bitfinex, an essentially stateless and unregulated platform. So there are probably few if any controls on who can buy into this bond, either by source or by amount.That means one simple thing: El Salvador will absolutely sell out of this bond, and will probably be able to issue another round. It will replace that $1.3 billion from the IMF without breaking a sweat, even taking into account that about half of the first bond sale will go into a bitcoin fund.There doesn’t need to be any further explanation of this than “Bitcoiners are nuts and rich,” and would gladly pump money into this small country for the lulz. More seriously, every one of these experiments that pans out is another win for bitcoin, so pitching in is also a matter of enlightened self-interest. Remember that an Ethereum DAO just raised $40 million for what was essentially a vaguely civic-minded prank – $1 billion for an actual bond with an actual return is nothing.Let’s leave aside the touted “Bitcoin City” El Salvador says it wants to build using the other half of the first bond. That’s mostly a marketing stunt: For $500 million, at best the country will get a couple of power plants, a server farm and an IHOP. And that’s actually fine! Assuming El Salvador follows through in broad strokes, you do need some kind of infrastructure to support the mining facilities, so whether or not it’s a “city” right off the bat is a matter of semantics. And $500 million of new capital in the small country will have a major impact regardless of how it’s spent.So, kudos to El Salvador for burning down Wall Street and building a throne out of the skulls of predatory bankers. That said, the bond might not be a terribly great investment.For one thing, it introduces political counterparty risk to your bitcoin strategy. This is a country that only emerged from near-anarchy in 1994, and while President Nayib Bukele seems to have sturdy popularity, a disruptive change in leadership or the political order could mean creditors don’t get paid back. That’s not necessarily likely, but it’s on the table in a way that it’s not with, say, U.S. Treasury bonds (or just buying bitcoin yourself).Also, Blockstream’s projection that the bond will return 165% annually over 10 years is based on the bet that bitcoin will be trading at $1 million by that time. I consider that completely possible, but also completely unknowable. A 10-year projection for literally any asset is pretty much always going to be a made-up number. Invest accordingly – unless your real priority is to change the world.Important events8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT (12:30 a.m. UTC) Australia retail sales (Oct.

At the time of publication, the cryptocurrency was trading above $56,500, down more than 4% over the past 24 hours. Ether followed a similar pattern, rallying before dropping to about $4,100.The cryptocurrencies and equities markets initially rose after the news that U.S. President Joe Biden had renominated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for another four-year term as head of the country’s central bank. Speculation had been that Biden would reappoint Powell or choose Fed Governor Lael Brainard.Some market observers see bitcoin’s price support holding at $55,000.“The downward pressure on major crypto assets like bitcoin and ether is to be expected,” BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin’s price increased more than 50% in the last 45 days to its all-time high. We expect the week to consolidate around $55K before rising again to $60K before the end of the month. We’ve repeatedly seen profit-taking in crypto when there are these quick run-ups.”DiPasquale added: “The news of Biden’s appointment of Powell is strong for crypto, as the U.S. has shown no signs of quantitative tightening; rather, just tapering the quantitative easing.”Technician’s takeBitcoin Struggled at $60K Resistance; Support Above $53KBitcoin four-hour price chart (Damanick Dantes/CoinDesk, TradingView)Bitcoin (BTC) buyers remained active over the weekend, although upside was limited around the $60,000 resistance level.The cryptocurrency continues to consolidate, with pullbacks limited toward $53,000 support.Intraday chart signals are neutral, suggesting the current loss of momentum could continue into the Asian trading session. Buyers will need to defend immediate support around $55,000 and decisively break above the short-term downtrend in order to yield further upside targets.Story continuesThe relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is approaching oversold levels, which could support a price recovery similar to what took place in late September.

WhaleAlert has recently reported a purchase of over 850 billion Shiba Inu coins, but this move also failed to provide material support to Shiba Inu.It looks that the interest in the coin is fading which is natural since Shiba Inu has been moving lower since late October, when it reached all-time high levels near $0.000090. Shiba Inu has already lost more than half of its value in less than one month, so traders’ interest in the coin is declining.Crypto markets are very dependent on momentum. According to CoinMarketCap, almost 15,000 cryptocurrencies exist in the world. While most cryptocurrencies are not available on major exchanges, traders still have plenty of options to choose from so they tend to move from one coin to another depending on the near-term trends.Not surprisingly, recent data from Google suggests that search interest in Shiba Inu coin is declining. Trends change quickly in the crypto world, and only the leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, managed to stay at the top of traders’ wishlists. The interest in other cryptocurrencies is often volatile, and they quickly move back and forth in rankings.At this point, it is obvious that Shiba Inu needs additional upside catalysts to break the current downside trend. Whale transactions failed to provide enough support to the cryptocurrency, and it needs to get back on the “hype train” to attract more traders.Technical AnalysisShiba Inu has recently made an attempt to settle above the resistance at the 50 EMA at $0.004245 but failed to develop sufficient upside momentum and moved back below the $0.000040 level. Currently, Shiba Inu is trying to settle below this level.Story continuesRSI remains in the moderate territory as Shiba Inu moves lower without huge sell-offs, so there is plenty of room to gain additional downside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.In case Shiba Inu manages to settle below the $0.000040 level, it will move towards the next support level which is located at the recent lows near $0.000036.A move below $0.000036 will push Shiba Inu towards the support at $0.000033, although it can also get some support near the $0.000035 level. If Shiba Inu declines below $0.000033, it will move towards the support at $0.000032.On the upside, a move above $0.000040 will push Shiba Inu towards the resistance at the 50 EMA. In case Shiba Inu manages to settle above the 50 EMA, it will head towards the next resistance level at $0.00004450. A successful test of this level will open the way to the test of the resistance at the 20 EMA near $0.000047.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Trying to RecoverGBP/USD Price Forecast – British Pound Continues to Look SickShiba Inu Keeps Moving Lower As Whale Transactions Fail To Provide Enough SupportBitcoin Price Prediction – Avoiding sub-$57,000 Would Bring $60,000 into PlaySAND Soars Over 260% In November While Metaverse is on FireStripe is Open to Accepting Crypto Payments Again","November 25, 2021, 1:20 AM"
67,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/next-shiba-inu-shib-retail-183152064.html,What Next for Shiba Inu (SHIB) as Retail Interest Ebbs?,"On the 28th of October, joke coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) hit a market capitalisation of above $54B. At the time, the price per coin reached an all-time high of just over $0.00008. That marked a near 2000% gain from the start of the month when the cryptocurrency’s price per coin was under $0.00001 and its market cap under $3.0B.The surge in Shiba Inu valuation went hand in hand with a rapid rise in retail interest in the coin. According to google trends, overall search interest in the term “Shiba Inu” surged by more than 30 times between the end of September and 27th of October. Similarly, over the same time period, Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric rose from under 20K to above 500K.Retail interest fadesBut as indicators of retail trader interest in the meme coin have faded in the subsequent weeks, SHIB’s price has gradually pulled back. According to google trends data, by the 23rd of November, overall search interest in “Shiba Inu” has dropped more than by 10 times compared to the record high on the 27th of October. Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric also pulled back to under 70K by the 23rd of November.Meanwhile, over the same time period, SHIB has come under pressure. The coin is now down over 50% from the late October record highs and trades just above $0.0004. That means its market cap has dropped to around $24B, according to TradingView.This is not the first time we have seen SHIB rise and fall in tandem with a rise and fall in retail investor interest in the meme coin. Recall back to May, when SHIB jumped from under $0.000002 to near $0.000035, a more than 20 fold increase in value, in a matter of days, before then sharply dipping back under $0.00001 (where it then stayed until October). That spike in valuation also coincided with a sharp uptick in search interest, according to google trends.What next for SHIB?Clearly then, if SHIB is to regain its mojo and head back to record levels, the retail trading/investing community is going to have to start getting excited about it again. Here the signs are tentatively promising. On Thursday the 25th of November, Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric lept back above 100K from close to 60K the day before. Similarly, in the last five days, their Social Engagement metric has risen from under 60K (a near-one-month low) to above 120K, a more than three-week high.Story continuesSHIB might be showing early signs of responding to this uptick in interest. The coin rose more than 20% in value on Thursday the 25th of November and is threatening a technical break above a downtrend that has suppressed the price action for the whole of November.Should SHIB break to the north of this level and should an acceleration in the coins gains rekindle retail trader/social media excitement about the coin, SHIB could be looking at some rapid gains back towards its prior record highs.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:S&P 500 Price Forecast – Futures Markets Quiet in Thin Holiday TradingNatural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Quiet During Holiday TradingGermany’s New Multi-party Government to Raise Investment but Maintain Fiscal DisciplineGold Price Forecast – Gold Markets Stable on ThanksgivingUSD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis – Convincing Breakout Over 115.615 Puts 118.601 – 118.658 on the RadarWTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+","November 25, 2021, 10:31 AM"

72,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kleiman-v-wright-craig-wright-035709970.html,Kleiman v. Wright: Craig Wright Takes Stand Again in Final Day of Testimony,"MIAMI – Testimony wrapped up Monday in the federal trial of Kleiman v. Wright, with Craig Wright – who has claimed to be the creator of Bitcoin and the person behind the name “Satoshi Nakamoto” – taking the witness stand a second time since the trial began three and a half weeks ago.His attorney, Andres Rivero, opened his line of questioning by asking, “Dr. Wright, did you form a business partnership with David Kleiman to invent and mine bitcoin?”“No,” Wright said bluntly.The trial pits Wright against the estate of his now-deceased friend Dave Kleiman. Kleiman’s surviving brother Ira claims that Dave helped Wright invent and mine bitcoin, that the two men had a business partnership and thus the estate is entitled to a portion of the bitcoin and intellectual property that allegedly resulted from that partnership. Testimony and evidence introduced during the trial focused on whether their relationship did or did not amount to a partnership.While Wright has claimed to be the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin since 2015, his claim has been met by skepticism by much of the Bitcoin community. Thus far, he has never been able to prove that he has control over the bitcoin keys or addresses associated with Satoshi Nakamoto. The potential ownership of those coins is at the center of the plaintiff’s civil suit against Wright.Read more: Kleiman v. Wright: Bitcoin’s Trial of the Century Kicks Off in MiamiMonday morning’s proceedings concluded the testimony of autism expert Dr. Ami Klin, who had begun testifying Friday. He said that Wright functions in social situations worse than 99% of the population and that “he gets very focused on the precise definition of words.”‘Electronic poker chip’Wright then took the stand, with Rivero leading him though an overview of his childhood and education. Wright said his parents split when he was five and he did not see his father after age 10. He was close to his maternal grandfather, who had been in the Australian air force and would build ham radios. He said his grandfather had a lot of Japanese memorabilia.Story continuesWright said he began coding computers when he was eight years old in 1979 and learned several coding languages. He said he earned multiple undergraduate and master’s degrees. He developed video games and did work for retailer Kmart and the Australian air force, then for gambling-related clients including MGM Grand and Lasseters Online Casino.In 2005, the U.S. government cracked down on the use of credit cards, checks and bank transfers to pay debts from illegal online gambling. Wright said he began developing the idea of a token system for online gaming that would get around problems with international money transfers.“A token is like an electronic poker chip,” Wright said.Lasseters’ online gambling operation closed in 2007. In the meantime, Wright said, he had been working with botnets, with the file-sharing service Limewire and with peer-to-peer networks. He wanted to share just how resilient such networks could be.“Rather than a single system, this was a distributed system so there were multiple nodes,” he said. It was more sustainable. If one company went broke, others could take over. “If one node goes down, it’s more profit for others. More profit attracts people,” he said.Wright said he started to formulate this idea in 2006 and it coalesced in 2007.Wright said he approached his then-boss at consulting firm BDO, Allan Granger, about collaborating on this. His legal team showed the court a document – notes from the meeting with Granger – with handwriting indicating that Wright would deliver a “doc” by October 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto posted the Bitcoin white paper on Oct. 31, 2008.Read more: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?Wright said people including Hal Finney, Wei Dai, and Gavin Andresen helped refine his project by giving him fragments of code and helping him de-bug his project.“Did you invite Dave Kleiman prior to 2007 to assist with the coding of bitcoin?” his attorney asked.“No, he couldn’t code,” Wright said.Conflicting datesBy March 2008, Wright testified, he had a handwritten version of what would become the Bitcoin white paper. He reduced that to a 40-page typed version, then a 20-page version, then a 10-page version, which is what he sent Dave Kleiman, he said.On cross-examination, plaintiffs’ counsel showed that Wright’s testimony Monday contradicted what he’d said last week — when he testified he’d sent Dave Kleiman a version of the white paper that was “horrendously long.” They also contended his notes from his meeting from Granger couldn’t be verified with metadata, as they were handwritten.Plaintiffs’ counsel also showed another contradiction: One of Wright’s email addresses was tied to the domain rcjbr.org. On Monday, Wright testified he’d created that domain, which combines the first letters of his wife’s name, his name and his kids’ names – on Oct. 27, 2011. He did not meet his wife until 2010. This detail implied he could not have written an email dated in 2008 from the rcjbr.org address to Dave Kleiman saying, “I need your help editing a paper … bitcash, bitcoin.”In a 2020 video deposition of Wright played for the jury, Wright was asked about the same document: “Is this a real email?” He said he’d sent something similar around that time.“Did you say/send these exact words?” he was asked in the video.“It looks like … yes,” he answered.Another apparent contradiction emerged Monday: Wright testified that he had mined bitcoin with computers in several locations in Australia and had additional servers in Tokyo and Malaysia. The plaintiffs then played a clip from a 2019 video deposition in which he testified he only mined in one Australian location, Bagnoo.Read more: In Craig Wright Trial, Plaintiffs Lay Out Pattern of Fraud, Deceit and HubrisWright’s motion deniedAlso on Monday, federal Judge Beth Bloom issued an order denying a motion by Wright’s legal team to essentially pre-empt the jury on seven counts.On Nov. 16, Wright’s legal team filed a Motion for Judgment of Law, arguing that the plaintiffs had rested their case without providing the jury with enough of an evidentiary basis to find in the plaintiffs’ favor.As the judge’s order explains, if “the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may resolve the issue against the party.”Wright’s team claimed (among other points) that the plaintiffs hadn’t provided enough evidence for the jury to appropriately value the bitcoins and intellectual property that are at issue in the case.Judge Bloom, however, wrote, “The Court is satisfied that the evidence presented at trial affords a sufficient basis for estimating the amount of damages with reasonable certainty. Specifically, the amount of [b]itcoin and its market price provide an adequate basis for the jury to calculate damages.”Similarly, regarding the valuation of intellectual property at issue, the judge’s order pointed out that Wright himself had told the Australian Tax Office that the intellectual property that he acquired after David Kleiman’s death was worth $56 million, and had circulated a report estimating the market price for W&K’s software at $303,895,458. W&K Info Defense Research is one of the business ventures in which the plaintiffs allege Dave Kleiman and Wright were partners.The parties will make closing arguments Tuesday.Catch up on the trial thus far:Kleiman v.

In case Bitcoin manages to settle below this level, it will move towards the next support level at $53,600 which will be bearish for other cryptocurrencies.Crypto markets are under some pressure today, and most leading cryptocurrencies are moving lower. Solana managed to get below the support at $216 and is moving towards the $210 level. XRP is stuck in the tight $1.03 – $1.05 range. Dogecoin is currently trying to settle below $0.22 while Shiba Inu is testing the support at the 50 EMA at $0.00004285.It should be noted that crypto markets have lost positive momentum in recent days, and it looks that their near-term performance will depend on whether Bitcoin manages to stay above the nearest support level at $56,000. If Bitcoin declines below this level, it will gain additional downside momentum which will have a negative impact on crypto markets.Technical AnalysisEthereum is testing the support level at $4,100. If this test is successful, Ethereum will head towards the next support at the 50 EMA at $3,950. RSI is in the moderate territory, and there is plenty of room to gain additional downside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.In case Ethereum gets below the 50 EMA, it will move towards the support at $3,715. A successful test of this level will open the way to the test of the support at $3,580. In case Ethereum manages to settle below this level, it will move towards the support at $3,400.On the upside, Ethereum needs to get above $4,200 to have a chance to test the resistance at the 20 EMA at $4,270. If Ethereum settles above the 20 EMA, it will move towards the next resistance at $4,535. A successful test of this level will open the way to the test of the resistance at $4,650.Story continuesFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Shiba Inu Slips in Coinbase Volume Rankings.

The cryptocurrency fell below the support level of $57,653, the Oct. 23 low, which has opened the doors for a deeper pullback.“There has been an 18% drawdown [from record high], but we have been here several times before, in Sep and Jun this year,” Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. “Bitcoin is still trading within the upward channel.”Mumbai-based crypto asset management company, MintingM, said that the cryptocurrency is still in a clear uptrend, making higher highs and higher lows on the daily time frame. As seen in the chart below, the upward or bullish channel, representing higher highs and higher lows, can be identified by trendlines connecting the lows of July 20 and Sept. 29, and the highs of June 30 and Sept. 7.Bitcoin was trading near $56,000 at press time, having hit a record high of $68,954 earlier this month.“There hasn’t been any strong catalyst to propel bitcoin’s price forward, and whales [large investors] have not been accumulating like they did in previous bull runs – which paints how global macro uncertainties have kept prices muted,” Stack Funds’ NEO said.Stack Funds’ COO and co-founder Matthew Dibb said the recent decline represents a typical bull market correction and may extended further. “There is mounting concern that inflationary pressures will cause a drop in risk assets, including bitcoin. We believe it will happen at some point, but it is not exactly imminent,” Dibb said.Action in traditional markets indicates potential for a deeper drawdown. The reappointment of Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, by U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday, reinforced bets that the central bank would hike rates faster to control inflation. U.S. stocks erased early gains, while gold and silver fell after Powell’s reappointment. The dollar index hit a 16-month high of 96.60 early Tuesday and the U.S. two-year yields rose to 0.63%, the highest since March 20.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Bitcoin flipped from support at $57,653 into resistance, with a firm close under the said level on Monday.

77,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doomsday-scenarios-defi-revolve-around-090548220.html,Doomsday Scenarios in DeFi Revolve Around Stablecoins USDC and USDT,"If decentralized finance were a character in a fable, we could imagine it as a rebel warrior taking on the world — traditional finance in particular. Then we can think about that rebel’s different body parts as composed of the industry’s best projects so far.So, its two fists might be Uniswap and Curve, the decentralized exchanges that are letting people put their resources behind a lot of ideas and move them around quickly as one fades and another looks promising.Basic financial products that let people do recognizable financial work but in a decentralized way, like Compound, Synthetix, Cover and dYdX, might be the arms that make our warrior strong. Ethereum itself would be — obviously — the heart, while long term plays — like Yearn, Convex and Index Co-op — might be thought of as the left brain and NFTs and crypto hijinks (like Jay Pegs Auto Mart) as the right brain.But what are the legs? What are the projects that, if they were to be cut out from under it, would make our metaphorical warrior fall to earth?Potential Weak PointsBased on crypto leaders The Defiant recently contacted, it seems clear that the legs holding up decentralized finance (DeFi) are two completely centralized products: the fiat-backed tokens, Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, and the stablecoin made by Circle and Coinbase, USDC.Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies built to maintain a price parity (or a “peg”) with something in the analog world, usually the dollar. The two stablecoins in question do this simply by making new tokens from US dollar deposits and promising to redeem their tokens for bank account dollars if any of their clients ask them to do so.Beyond the two stablecoins, there’s a variety of other potential weak points in DeFi right now (oracle manipulation, governance attacks, cross-chain contagion), but anyone looking for potential black swans that could rock the $250 billion locked up in this industry should keep an eye on the top stablecoins.Story continuesFor example, Arjun Bhuptani of the Connext Network sketched out the basic scenario if USDT were to just completely lose its peg due to the longstanding uncertainty about its solvency. Every decentralized exchange pool that held it would fall apart, causing massive losses as folks both rushed to exit their liquidity provider positions and traders attacked them for arbitrage opportunities. Investment protocols, such as Yearn and StakeDAO, that depend on liquidity pools would hemorrhage funds.“I’m pretty worried about the possibility of a major stablecoin de-pegging or being found to be un/undercollateralized. For instance, if there’s a run on USDT, that would likely break most of DeFi”Arjun Bhuptani “I think in general you should consider something like this, a 2008-financial-crisis-like doomsday scenario,” Bhuptani said in an email. “I see no instance where a situation like this doesn’t cause people to panic and try to exit everything they can ASAP, which, in turn, causes a run on most liquidity/debt in the whole DeFi space.”But Bhuptani admits these are just guesses. The truth is no one really knows.“A market crash such as 2017 has no precedent in the DeFi ecosystem yet,” Rafaella Baraldo, co-founder Pods Finance, a hedging platform, wrote in an email. “The closest we have from a crash is March 2020, and by then, the ecosystem was far different from what it is now. On chain usage has increased, and protocols are highly dependent on each other.”Or as Boring Crypto, the pseudonymous coder who designed BentoBox, SushiSwap‘s lending platform, told The Defiant via Twitter DM, “With a few exceptions it’s all a house of cards unfortunately.”Not everyone was quite so nervous. Michael Feng, CEO of CoinAlpha, which made Hummingbot, the market making platform, wrote in an email that USDC and USDT are just not that dangerous. “Those instruments are relatively simple, collateralized by highly liquid instruments like BTC and USD, and under high scrutiny by regulators,” he wrote. “That’s not where the real risks lie.”USDT’s solvency is a worry.Both stablecoins theoretically face the same dangers: regulatory (authorities crack down or demand censorship of certain users), collateral risk (the assets backing the stablecoin lose value or the public loses faith) and security (either collateral gets stolen or unbacked stablecoins get printed and spent before anyone notices).But most people worry more about USDT’s solvency and about USDC’s eagerness to comply with the authorities.If something should go wrong it’s especially scary in crypto because all the technology places extremely high value on finality, that a thing is done once it’s done.“The issue is that DeFi has no form of recourse — there is no undo button,” Hart Lambur, co-founder of the UMA protocol, which makes synthetic assets and other unique financial products, wrote in an email. “It’s pretty hard (maybe impossible?) to build a system that can scale to trillions in value unless there is some way to ‘undo’ bad things when they happen.”Imagine our rebel warrior was suddenly forced to fight with a splint on one leg. That might be a rough metaphor for USDC in a time of regulatory aggression.USDC is the coin of the realm in DeFi. Since around October 2020, it’s been the most popular stablecoin in DeFi by TVL, according to Flipside Crypto.DeFi’s leaders fear regulators will use the two US-based companies behind USDC to put the screws to DeFi, which they could do. USDC is primarily a Circle project and there’s nothing about the company that suggests it would do anything but roll over for the money cops. Its founder, Jeremy Allaire, has been trying to put cryptocurrency into a business suit since before Circle even launched its first products.“I think USDC freezing accounts would cripple DeFi because of how many things ultimately trace back to USDC exposure — DAI, base pairs in many LP pools, etc.” Avichal Garg, managing partner of Electric Capital told The Defiant via email.Freezing funds would not be unprecedented. The question is: will they ever do it at a massive scale?Centre is the organization that Coinbase and Circle set up to run the product. Jessica Gardner from its business operations team sent The Defiant the following statement:“Centre’s Access Denial Policy is … designed to comply with a law, regulation, or legal order from governmental authority with jurisdiction over Centre; or under extreme cases where it’s necessary to prevent a threat to the security, integrity, or reliability of the USDC Network.”Major VulnerabilityWithin DeFi, USDC has enormous scale. Take Uniswap, the crossroads of DeFi. USDC is the second largest token on the application, after ETH, with $581M of the $3.9B locked up in the decentralized exchange, as of Nov. 18, but that’s probably not the most important fact about USDC on Uniswap.USDC is paired with another token in 64 of its pools that have more than $1M in TVL (there are almost 400 pools that have ever had USDC in them and lots more pools with tiny balances).ETH is paired with many more tokens, of course, with 189 pools that have more than $1M, but the next most liquid token on Uniswap, WBTC, is only in 10 pools with over $1M. USDC also makes up $3.5B of the $18.4B supplied value on Compound, the money market. According to The Defiant Terminal’s data, there is 538.5M USDC in Aave (approximately 4% of the total value locked), 1.38B in Curve (~9%), 2.4B in Maker (~13%), 196M in SushiSwap (~5%) and 776M in Uniswap (~9%), as of Nov. 19.For a while there, USDC was a major vulnerability for DAI, the most popular decentralized stablecoin. USDC has made up a dauntingly large portion of collateral for DAI ever since March 2020 when MakerDAO was economically exploited and the system briefly had a few million dollars worth of unbacked DAI.Unforeseen RegulationSince early November, though, USDC is now a reasonable 12% of DAI’s underlying collateral, with ETH itself once again making up the lion’s share, according to DAI stats, and WBTC also a healthy portion.But a failure in confidence in USDC wouldn’t be good for DAI nor any facet of DeFi. and, if USDC ever engenders uncertainty in crypto, it is the most likely to do so by putting law as law before code as law. “Censorship by unforeseen regulation could impact DeFi protocols in a way that we don’t yet understand, ” Baraldo said, echoing a concern brought up by many leaders.Until the authorities act, there’s no way to know how far they will go and what USDC’s stewards will comply with. It might depend on whether or not regulators demand only that certain suspect wallets get frozen or if they go further, ordering that any USDC that has ever touched a suspect wallet gets frozen. Were that to happen, there could be millions of USDC now sitting in smart contracts that would suddenly no longer be liquid.“USDC freeze means big chunks of DeFi have USDC that are frozen but no one knows which addresses actually, so everyone tries to get their USDC out which is basically a run on the bank,” Garg said.Jeremy Allaire is the CEO of Circle.Michael Egorov, Curve’s creator, is less concerned about the censorship scenario. “When USDC or USDT are required to do some things for regulatory compliance which impede their use a lot — but they do not lose backing — that probably would still work,” he told The Defiant via emailThere’s a long term, softer issue as well. USDC is highly associated with Coinbase. Together, they are seen as the legitimate, regulated, “safe” way to be part of the DeFi world. If USDC becomes seen as unreliable, but makes the normies a lot more guarded about this space for a lot longer.“This affects the long-term trust of a portion of the mass market. Which reduces demand of crypto and DeFi in the long run” Lisa Jy Tan of Economics Design told The Defiant via email.Chief FearOf course anyone’s leg can go out at any time, and USDC could certainly give way like anything can — things fall apart, but many people worry more about Tether actually failing than its rival, a scenario in which one of our imagined warrior’s legs loses all its strength.Or even just gets chopped off.There’s a lot of USDT out there too. According to The Defiant Terminal data, there is 183.6M in Aave (approximately 1.4% of TVL), 1.5B in Curve (~9.6%), 413M in Uniswap (~5%) and 97M in SushiSwap (2.6%).The chief fear about USDT is that all the rumors about its solvency have always been true and finally the market becomes convinced. Tether has constantly been hounded by suspicion that it does not hold nearly enough assets to cover all the Tether, all $73 billion worth, in existence.In October, it paid $41M to settle a suit by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its statements that its tokens are fully backed by fiat-currency.“I’m pretty worried about the possibility of a major stablecoin de-pegging or being found to be un/undercollateralized. For instance, if there’s a run on USDT, that would likely break most of DeFi,” Connext’s Bhuptani said.This is not the kind of thing that happens gradually. If it happens, it will happen all at once.“I will describe ‘fail’ as a stablecoin permanently losing its peg. In the most severe case, the stablecoin becomes worthless.”Kenny WhiteIt’s not just DeFi though. USDT’s failure would spread repercussions across every blockchain like fresh cracks in a shattered windshield, because Bitcoin depends on USDT for liquidity. “A big factor in determining whether a failed stablecoin will be an existential crisis or just extremely expensive is how much the price of ETH, BTC and other cryptocurrencies go down,” Kenny White, CEO of Cowri Labs, which makes the Shell Protocol, told The Defiant via email. “My hunch is that a lot of risk modeling underestimates how high this correlation might be.”Tan, however, did not think there was a lot of doubt here about what would happen: “USDT is highly important to BTC trade. USDT fall = BTC ngmi.”And as BTC goes, so does the rest of the market.“First, we should try to define what ‘fail’ means in this context,” White said. “I will describe ‘fail’ as a stablecoin permanently losing its peg. In the most severe case, the stablecoin becomes worthless. There are a variety of ways a stablecoin can fail. If Tether were to fail, at minimum the price of bitcoin, ether and all other crypto currencies would take a huge hit. I also suspect that a few centralized exchanges would be rendered insolvent.”Tether did not reply to multiple requests for comment from The Defiant.Extremely Important ProtocolThe thing about economies is that everything in them is connected, and in DeFi it’s all connected programmatically. Let’s take a particular case in point, that of Curve, the decentralized exchange that specializes in stablecoins of various kinds.As we’ve previously reported, Curve is an extremely important protocol to DeFi’s yield seekers. Stablecoins rely on it to drive liquidity. Yield aggregators rely on it for returns. If a major stablecoin tanked, that would hit Curve extremely hard as well as all projects attached to it.“If USDT were to depeg tomorrow (because, for instance, they found that tether is only 20% collateralized and therefore insolvent), that would cause every USDT-denominated liquidity pool in the space to implode,” Bhuptani said.Curve has been cleverly designed to be flexible. Curve uses metapools in order to improve liquidity. So, while most pools on Uniswap are pools of two tokens that are only dedicated to that pool, Curve uses composability internally. Many pools on Curve are one token paired with another pool (for stablecoins, that’s the 3-Pool, which holds DAI, USDC and USDT).So, anything that goes wrong with 3-Pool spreads immediately to lots of other pools.No Protection“Any other Curve pool holding the 3-Pool LP token will also fail. So basically a majority of Curve would fail (unless there is a back door to freeze the pools and halt trading),” White wrote.Michael Egorov, Curve’s creator, confirmed that an unraveling of any of the big cryptocurrencies would be far reaching. “There is no protection there really. Many pools are dependent on 3-Pool, and if any of the major stables loses the backing forever — this is very bad,” he said via email.From there it spreads, “What happens if a large majority of Curve’s TVL disappears overnight? Protocols such as Yearn would also probably go insolvent. And of course any protocol with exposure to Yearn would be affected,” White said.Beyond that though, it gets a lot harder to predict what will happen, Tan explained. The next question: Do people retreat within crypto or out of crypto entirely? If they retreat within crypto, say to other stablecoins, that could cause their prices to become “messy” she said, as demand pushes up the smaller stablecoins’ prices and then the protocols behind them try to drive the price back down during an erratic time.Central Banks of CryptoWe just don’t know how people and protocols would behave under that kind of stress in this brand new industry.Then there’s another scenario that one of the chief delegates in MakerDAO governance pointed out to The Defiant.Every now and then, a central bank gets caught messing with the rate of interest to borrow their fiat currency, PaperImperium told The Defiant. It doesn’t tend to work out, but it happens.If central banks do it, it’s not impossible to imagine that these central banks of crypto could give in to the same temptation one day.“If Tether or USDC or DAI decided to suppress market interest rates on their coin, they would eventually be in a position where they would run out of reserves to defend their peg on the open market/redemptions,” PaperImperium wrote via Twitter DM.“DeFi composability is awesome, but that means each subsequent building block inherits the risk of underlying blocks…”Arjun BhuptaniHere’s how that could work, in a very simple model: If a stablecoin wanted to see more trading volume, it could supply a lot to lending platforms such as Aave, which would push down the cost to borrow it. If they did it enough, there would end up being more of the coin in the market than the market wanted, so it might start to fall below its peg.Fiat backed stablecoins defend their peg by allowing users to withdraw fiat at the pegged rate. So if, say, USDT did this, and Tether was at $0.97, a big arbitrageur could buy a 10 million USDT and redeem it for USD, clearing an easy $300,000 profit.The danger here is if they keep pushing the borrowing rate down, they lose collateral. Which would maybe matter or maybe it wouldn’t. After all, if they are behaving correctly, tokens get burned as they get redeemed. Under this scenario, though, the financial controls might have come off.“I don’t think anyone would be so economically illiterate as to do that. But as I say, central banks try it (and fail) on a fairly regular basis,” PaperImperium wrote.True DangersIt’s important to keep the really out there threats in mind but the true dangers are probably simpler: a total depegging or regulators making a play to slam on DeFi’s brakes.And it’s also worth remembering that crypto works differently than the traditional economy and might behave differently in a crisis. “Crypto is actually more anti-fragile than traditional finance because holders are a lot more decentralized,” Coin Alpha’s Feng said. “Unlike traditional finance where insolvency of the U.S. government would cause huge problems, there are virtually no ‘too big to fail’ institutions.”Still, one has to keep in mind that DeFi’s applications are hyper-interconnected, and that is why it’s helpful to think of DeFi as one body, as a rebel warrior, albeit with some neat, cutting edge armor and an excellent physique. Nevertheless, it is still all extremely interconnected, like any body, so what hurts one part can create a contagion to the rest.“DeFi composability is awesome, but that means each subsequent building block inherits the risk of underlying blocks,” Bhuptani said.Or maybe it’s not the underlying blocks? Maybe it’s the blocks on top. If the two leading fiat-backed stablecoins really are the legs this industry stands atop? Even the most skilled warrior loses their edge when a leg goes.Read the original post on The Defiant.","November 23, 2021, 1:05 AM"

The second major resistance level sits at $60,892.Failure to move back through the $57,150 pivot would bring the first major support level at $54,845 back into play.Barring an extended sell-off through the afternoon, however, Bitcoin should avoid the 23.6% FIB of $53,628.The second major support level sits at $53,408.Looking beyond the support and resistance levels, we saw the 50 EMA pull further back from the 100 and 200 EMAs this morning.We also saw the 100 EMA pullback from the 200, delivering further downside pressure.A further pullback of the 50 EMA from the 100 would bring sub-$54,000 levels into play.Key through the late morning and early afternoon would be to move back through the day’s pivot level and visit $58,500 levels to then target a return to $60,000.Failure to move back through the day’s pivot, however, would deliver another loss for the Bitcoin bulls.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:GBP/USD Price Forecast – British Pound Pierces Previous SupportPrice of Gold Fundamental Daily Forecast – Rising Yields have Gold Sellers Targeting $1781.00 – $1757.10Citigroup’s Latest Appointment Shows Financial Institutions are Serious About Digital AssetsDaily Gold News: Tuesday, Nov. 23 – Gold Sold Off Amid Powell’s Reappointment, Stocks’ VolatilityOil Price Fundamental Daily Forecast – Expect OPEC+ Counter-Punch to Offset SPR ReleasesGBP/JPY Price Forecast – British Pound Hanging Around 50 Day EMA Still","November 23, 2021, 3:07 AM"

As a result, we will be limiting the ability for U.S. users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX,” said an eToro spokesperson.Starting December 26, users won’t be able to open new positions in either coin, and their ability to receive a yield for staking those same assets will end on December 31.While eToro assured customers they will not be forced to sell their existing holdings in those cryptocurrencies, both assets came under selling pressure since the announcement. eToro did not specify exactly what concerns prompted the move.   Mati Greenspan, CEO of investment research firm Quantum Economics, told Yahoo Finance that he couldn’t immediately identify which U.S. regulations affect ADA and TRX that don’t also apply to the rest of the crypto market.“As a user and former employee I support their decision but a bit more clarity into their train of thought would be appreciated by the community,” said Greenspan.'Unclear' motivesCardano tumbled after a crypto platform moved to limit trading in the digital coin.The wide reaching effort to rein in what Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has called the ""Wild West"" of digital currencies has stirred uncertainty in the crypto sector. It's led to some market players scrambling to influence the debate over regulation — and others to try and get out ahead of possible enforcement actions, which could be driving eToro's thinking.The SEC classifies Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) - the two largest cryptocurrencies - as commodities instead of securities, but most cryptocurrencies sold on exchanges to U.S. investors aren’t registered as such.Story continuesExpressing his personal views numerous times since taking office as the SEC’s head, Gensler has said that many crypto assets — especially those that fall in the Decentralized Finance or DeFi space — are 'Decentralized In Name Only (DINO)’. That means the SEC could very well begin to take enforcement action on crypto exchanges that offer these assets.In December 2020, the SEC announced that it would sue another top cryptocurrency, Ripple (XRP). While the lawsuit is ongoing, roughly 80 different cryptocurrency exchanges at least briefly de-listed XRP according to Carol Goforth, a Law Professor at the University of Arkansas who specializes in securities and crypto regulation.“That is where I have seen most of the de-listing that has occurred, but it's not clear yet that’s what is going on here,” Goforth told Yahoo Finance.Like stablecoins, crypto lending or offering customers the chance to earn “staking rewards” has drawn scrutiny from regulators. In September, the SEC cut short Coinbase’s efforts to launch their own lending service, with Gensler insisting that the product offering needed to be registered as a security. Meanwhile, crypto lenders BlockFi — reportedly under investigation by the SEC — and Celsius Network have faced numerous cease and desist orders from state securities regulators.There are a number of reasons why an exchange might want to “de-list” a cryptocurrency for U.S. consumers according to Goforth. But she could not determine any unique characteristic of ADA or TRX which would make them a target for regulators. Underscoring the opaqueness of eToro's decision, Bitstamp — a far larger exchange — just recently listed Cardano for trading, which made the move to limit trading ""particularly confusing, unless eToro knows something that we don’t,” said Goforth. Conversely, “Tron has a relatively high trading volume, but again, I don’t see anything that makes it particularly likely to be a target for regulators.”Goforth suggested eToro might have also be using an “internal reviewing” process that points to these assets being riskier, or more likely to be the targets of regulatory attention.David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

Howe Institute said.“Canadian-dollar-linked stablecoins could become attractive to Canadians by making them convertible into cash issued by the Bank of Canada, and ensuring that stablecoins are well designed and regulated from business conduct, competitive, operational, privacy and prudential perspectives,” wrote Mark Zelmer and Jeremy Kronick, the authors of the report.A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price. Recently nominated vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Lael Brainard, has voiced her support for the potential advantages of a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC).Indirect CBDCSuch a feat by the Bank of Canada will require any potential stablecoins to be well designed and regulated to make them attractive to Canadians, Zelmer and Kronick wrote. The digital currency should also be issued in token form, with decentralized technology for settling transactions, allowing Canadians to retain most of the benefits of a paper currency, the authors added.“Our preference is for an ‘indirect CBDC,’ one that is allowed to pass over the balance sheet of payment providers, mimicking cash/banknotes on the Bank of Canada’s balance sheet today,” the duo said.The authors also highlighted that such adoption may incentivize private sectors to introduce Canadian-dollar linked stablecoins by enabling convertibility to cash to take place digitally, without relying on physical bank notes.On Feb. 25, Canadian bank VersaBank said it plans to launch a stablecoin “VCAD” which will be pegged to the Canadian dollar on a 1:1 ratio basis.A new chapterThe Bank of Canada adopting a digital currency that is convertible into Canadian dollars could usher in a new chapter in how Canadians pay for their goods and services. According to the report, however, this move can only be successful if there is a mass adoption by the consumers and there are infrastructures to support such use of digital currencies.“Canadians are more likely to favor those stablecoins if governments facilitate innovation in the payments world so that Canadians can benefit from ongoing advances in payments systems and crypto-technology, and the purchasing power of the Canadian dollar is maintained by keeping inflation low,” the authors concluded.","November 25, 2021, 10:21 AM"

Within a week, it's already raised $1.7 million in ethereum. It's a big number, but also far from the price tag on teams like the the Utah Jazz, which sold for $1.6 billion in December 2020, Decrypt said.A DAO, an acronym that stands for decentralized autonomous organization, is essentially a group of internet friends who decide to form a group with a common purpose, like creating a social club or crowdfunding to make a purchase. The rules of that group are then established and enforced with an underlying code that runs on the blockchain. The group often even mints its own cryptocurrency.Just last week, the concept of a DAO shot into the mainstream when one called ConstitutionDAO attempted to buy one of the original copies of the US Constitution. But it was outbid by Citadel Securities' Ken Griffin.That group's rallying cry was WGBTC, short for ""we're going to buy the constitution."" For Krause House, it's ""WAGBAT,"" meaning ""we're all gonna buy a team."" The new DAO started its fundraise last week by selling NFTs, aka non-fungible tokens, to act as a type of admission ticket to the group's Discord server and an allotment of KRAUSE tokens, Decrypt said.On its website, it says it's ""a community of hoop fanatics that are just crazy enough to buy an NBA team"" but also noted it may not be able to achieve its goal.In a message to Insider, the DAO said it's on a ""very pragmatic path to achieving"" its vision and is experimenting with basketball opportunities with the G League (the NBA's developmental league), the NBL (Australia and New Zealand's pro league), and the WNBA, so it has a proven track record when it's eventually able to submit a bid for a team.Story continues""This is not a question of if, it's a question of when,"" the group told Insider.On its site, it said NBA franchises shouldn't be limited to billionaires, ""but rather a movement of individuals that want to be a part of the greatest professional league in the world.""Read the original article on Business Insider","November 23, 2021, 6:55 AM"

To sign up click here and scroll down to the tech icon.NewslettersHere’s a teaser from this week’s edition:Amid a flurry of fireworks, blaring rock music and cheering crowds, the president of El Salvador took to the stage at LaBitConf 2021 conference over the weekend to unveil his vision for a volcano-powered ‘Bitcoin City’.As arguably the world’s least conventional world leader, Nayib Bukele is as disruptive and divisive as bitcoin itself. The self-proclaimed “coolest dictator in the world” and “CEO of El Salvador” oversaw the country becoming the first in the world to adopt the cryptocurrency as a legal form of tender earlier this year, and has plans to begin a revolution not just in his country, but the entire world.Decked in all white and wearing his trademark backwards baseball cap, Bukele used Alexander the Great as an analogy for what he was hoping to achieve with Bitcoin City. “When Alexander the Great was conquering the world, he established these Alexandria cities all over the empire,” he told the crowd. “The whole point of these Alexandrias was to be the beacons of hope for the rest of the world. I thought, if you want bitcoin to spread all over the world, we should build some Alexandrias. We should build the first Alexandria here in El Salvador.”Built in the shadow of the Conchagua volcano on the country’s southern tip, Bitcoin City is envisioned as a kind of libertarian utopia crossed with an environmentalist’s fantasyland, combining zero income and property tax with zero CO2 emissions.It will be a proper legal municipality, complete with an elected mayor, residential and commercial areas, museums, airports – “everything devoted to bitcoin” – even a plaza designed in the shape of the cryptocurrency’s logo.To finance the city, El Salvador partnered with digital assets firm Blockstream to launch a $1 billion bitcoin bond, with the company saying the city will bring about the acceleration of “hyperbitcoinisation” – a bold new era where the cryptocurrency usurps the US dollar to become the default value system of the world.Bitcoin evangelicals like Bukele cite the digital currency’s borderless, censorship-resistant technology for its potential to displace the dollar and transform the current financial system into one that favours the masses, not just the massively wealthy...Bitcoin price collapse explainedTuesday 23 November 2021 16:12 , Anthony CuthbertsonBitcoin is now down more than $10,000 from the peak it reached on 10 November, with still no solid signs of the price slide stopping.Speaking to various analysts and experts, we heard their thoughts on what caused this latest price correction – and where the cryptocurrency might go from here.

Some analysts are saying there is resistance at this level, though during periods of price discovery the market can be particularly volatile.Other leading cryptocurrencies are also seeing heavy losses, with Ethereum (ether), Binance Coin, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ada) all falling in price by between 5- 8 per cent on Monday.Here’s what Simon Peters, an analyst at the online trading platform eToro, has to say about the latest market correction: “With bitcoin and other cryptoassets having reached fresh all-time highs, there was always likely to be a measure of profit-taking from investors which then translates into price weakness. Both BTC and ETH go from strength to strength, and the ups and downs of the market are a part of this story.”President Bukele to keynote major bitcoin conferenceMonday 22 November 2021 17:16 , Anthony CuthbertsonAfter barely catching his breath from belting out his ambition to build Bitcoin City, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has said he will appear at one of the biggest cryptocurrency conferences on the calendar.Bitcoin 2022 will take place in Miami next April, providing a platform for many of the leading figures within the crypto industry.

At the time it was considered to be the largest city in the ancient world before being overtaken by Rome.The idea of Bitcoin City in El Salvador would include a quadruple-threat approach to an urban location, plus renewed ideas regarding energy, physical space, and taxation.That also means the city would not suffer from CO2 emissions since everything would be powered by the volcano adjacent to the planned site.The only taxation of a citizen in Bitcoin City would be a 10% sales tax.Bitcoin-backed bonds as a guaranteeBitcoin City would also be partially be funded by Bitcoin-backed bonds – a local government issue of a $1bn tokenized bond that will carry a 6.5% yield for investors.Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of Blockstream, said the plans include making El Salvador “the financial centre of the world” and “the Singapore of Latin America”.Mow also added he expects other countries to follow suit.“The first countries that do this will have a massive advantage. This is the beginning of nation-state Bitcoin FOMO,” Mow said, referring to the term ‘fear of missing out’.According to Blockstream’s blog post “the $1bn raised will be split between a $500m allocation of Bitcoin (BTC) and a $500m infrastructure spend for building out energy and Bitcoin mining infrastructure in the region”.El Salvador also aims to create a government securities law and grant a license to Bitfinex Securities to process the bond issuance.Also, the Bitcoin Bond would have special dividends dispersed on an annual basis generated by the staggered liquidation of Bitcoin.Using Blockstream’s Asset Management Platform (AMP), dividends are easily paid out to bondholders.","November 23, 2021, 7:15 AM"

A ring of hackers called the ""The Community"" allegedly hijacked the identities of US citizens to steal more than $50 million in cryptocurrencies between 2017 and 2018. Corey De Rose is facing extradition as he is being accused of aiding in the hack of an American man's crypto wallet in 2017, when De Rose was 18.US lawyers at a London court hearing on Monday said he helped transfer crypto from the man's digital wallet to himself and his co-conspirators. De Rose was accused of receiving 108.18 bitcoins in the theft.

Lord of the Rings-themed crypto token has been blocked by JRR Tolkien's estate,"A gold ringPBO PhotographyThe family of Lord of the Rings author JRR Tolkien have won a court ruling to shut down a ""ring trilogy-themed"" crypto token.The creator of the ""JRR token"" must cease trading and remove all infringing content, according to media reports.A number of cryptocurrencies have arisen from pop culture such as dogecoin, the Squid Game token and even Elon Musk's dog.Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.A cryptocurrency inspired by the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was barred from operating on Tuesday after the family and estate of author JRR Tolkien brought legal action against the digital token's creator.The ""JRR token"", created by Florida-based developer Matthew Jensen, launched in August this year. Tolkien's estate brought a copyright infringement complaint to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) within weeks, stating the token's website included references to the writer's famous fantasy fiction series, including its characters and other images.At the center of the complaint was the use of the domain name ""www.jrrtoken.com"". The WIPO arbitration process found in favor of Tolkien's estate. According to a press release emailed on Tuesday by the Tolkein family's lawyers - Maier Blackburn Solicitors - Jensen must immediately cease trading and remove all content referring to the token across its website and social media accounts.The token which had launched in August had managed to accumulate 512 wallet addresses according to BSC scan. It also listed nine non-fungible tokens for sale on the OpenSea marketplace.""This was a particularly flagrant case of infringement, and the estate is pleased that it has been concluded on satisfactory terms,"" Steve Maier, of Maier Blackburn Solicitors, said in the statement.Jensen was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Insider.As part of the WIPO arbitration, Jensen had said the domain name was not identical to the Lord of the Rings creator's name. ""Specifically, the Complainant's J R R TOLKIEN trademark contains the additional letters ""L"" and ""I"" which are conspicuously absent from the disputed domain name. The pronunciation is also different,"" he said.Story continuesThe JRR Token's website, Twitter account and YouTube channel have now been deleted.With hundreds of new cryptocurrencies created daily, it's unlikely that the demise of the Lord of the Rings-inspired token will mark the end of digital tokens inspired by mainstream culture. Dogecoin, one of the world's most widely traded cryptos, was based on a popular internet meme, giving rise to spinoffs that include the floki inu token, named after Elon Musk's dog. They're not all harmless though. Earlier this month saw the sudden rise of the Squid Game token, which took its name from the record-breaking Korean Netflix show, that later turned out to be fraudulent.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 23, 2021, 7:23 AM"

Photo: Screen grab from Parliament LiveBank of England (BoE) officials have said that if a central bank digital currency (CBDC) was introduced, 20% of deposits could move out of the commercial banking system as a result.Speaking at the Economic Affairs Committee in the Lords on Tuesday, Sir Jon Cunliffe, the bank's deputy governor for financial stability, said it had made a ""prudent assessment"" of the 20% move. He also said banks could potentially lose a revenue stream from payments as a result of its implementation. Cunliffe added that if banks are healthy and competitive they will adjust to this change, just as they had been nimble in the face of change in the past. He also said that there is a future in cash too, which would have an anchoring role in financial stability of systems. A potential digital pound, dubbed 'Britcoin' by the press, has been in the offing since April this year. In September, the bank brought in representatives from ASOS (ASC.L), Spotify (SPOT) and PayPal (PYPL), among other companies, to consult on its CBDC Engagement and Technology forums.BoE governor Andrew Bailey also told the committee that despite the ""large and rapid growth"" of stable coins and digital assets around the world, it is ""not regarded as a direct financial stability issue"". The question becomes, 'how do we tackle that world?', he said, offering two options. One would be to regulate so-called stable coins and the other would be to bring in a CBDC. Read more: Lord of the Rings cryptocurrency taken to task by JRR Tolkien's estateCunliffe went on to say that there are a number of issues that need to be addressed and tested before any CBDC is brought in in the UK, as well as time given for the banking system to adjust while it changes. He also said the bank didn't yet have visibility on predicted uptake by consumers as it did not yet know the full scope of what a CBDC would mean for the UK. Story continuesThe bank recently laid out its plans for the next stage of development in digital currency in the UK. If the results of this ""development"" phase conclude that the case for CBDC is made, and that it is operationally and technologically robust, then the earliest date for launch of a UK CBDC would be in the second half of the decade, it said at the time.In a statement earlier in November, the Bank said that in 2022, the Treasury and the Bank will launch a consultation which will set out their assessment of the case for a UK CBDC, including the merits of further work to develop an operational and technology model.Watch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?","November 23, 2021, 8:09 AM"

Here's a refresher on the craziest stories this year, from meme stocks to NFTs.","The Thanksgiving turkey.Hiroko Masuike/Getty ImagesMarkets have been on a wild ride in 2021 amid new phenomena like meme stocks, NFTs, and DAOs.The year began with shares of GameStop soaring and is ending with a DAO trying to buy the US Constitution.Here are 10 conversation starters about markets to avoid politics at Thanksgiving this year.Forget politics at your Thanksgiving dinner this year. Talk markets.Think about everything that happened this year, starting with an army of retail traders causing GameStop shares to spike, to cute Japanese puppies becoming the mascots for a crypto revolution, and ending in a bunch of internet friends trying to buy the US Constitution.So here's a refresher of what happened with 10 possible ideas to get the conversation going on Thanksgiving.1) What's your favorite meme stock?Meme stocks became the first big market event this year when an army of retail traders mobilized on Reddit to drive up the prices of cheap stocks like GameStop, AMC, and BlackBerry. Then well-known trading app Robinhood halted the buying of meme stocks, initiating an uproar from traders, a Congressional hearing and a regulatory report. The meme-stock phenomenon has continued throughout the year, with new companies constantly added to the basket. For some, AMC is still their favorite. It's now accepting cryptocurrency as payment, and its CEO is a hit among retail traders.2) Want to see my NFT?Non-fungible tokens surged in popularity this year, and now the market as a whole is worth billions of dollars. The tokens are generally digital pieces of art tied to the blockchain. They're worth anywhere from a handful of dollars to millions of dollars. If you're really a crypto enthusiast, you might even bring your tungsten cube to Thanksgiving dinner. The cubes have become all the rage in the crypto world for their small size and surprising density.Shiba inu dog.Yuki Cheung/EyeEm/Getty3) I've been thinking about buying a shiba inu! (The puppy not the coin; I already have that).Demand for the Japanese hunting dogs has surged this year along with the price of meme coins like dogecoin and shiba inu coin. The cryptocurrencies, whose mascot is the shiba inu, have garnered the attention of the retail investing crowd, in addition to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and AMC CEO Adam Aron. Another shiba inu-based coin called Floki, a reference to Musk's new Japanese pup, has also joined the space. Be careful if you want to buy in, though, the cryptocurrencies — and the dogs — can be volatile.Story continues4) How's your home improvement project going with those crazy lumber prices?Inflation is at 30-year highs thanks to a bevy of factors like shortages, supply chain bottlenecks, and government stimulus checks, among others. The price of lumber, along with a lot of other costs, surged this year as first-time buyers joined the housing market and current homeowners made updates. More recently, lumber prices have since slumped from highs earlier in the year.5) I ordered my PS5 forever ago. One wrong turn in the Suez Canal, and I'm stuck with what I've got.In March, the Ever Given cargo ship became lodged in the pivotal waterway, prompting memes and adding to supply chain problems. After about a week blocking the canal, a fleet of tugboats and a dredger successfully freed the vessel.6) Have you seen my Facebook — ahem, the company formerly known as Facebook — posts lately?Facebook is no longer Facebook. In October, it rebranded to Meta as it plans to move into virtual reality and the future of the internet that has been dubbed the metaverse. Since then, the concept of the metaverse has become mainstream.Elon Musk.Picture Alliance/Getty Images7) Let's talk about voting! Did you vote yes or no on Elon Musk's poll to sell his Tesla shares?Musk posted a poll on Twitter on Nov. 6 asking if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. The resounding answer was yes, and he's so far offloaded about $9 billion worth of shares. The Tesla chief's tweets have become increasingly influential this year, as his posts about digital assets, like dogecoin, bitcoin, and ethereum, have helped drive broad crypto rallies. On top of that, his own company has joined the $1 trillion club, and he's now the wealthiest man in the world.8) What did you think of Squid Game?The Netflix hit show that garnered more than 140 million viewers, according to Forbes, also inspired a cryptocurrency that soared in value in a matter of days in October. But it was a scam. The owners took their profits and the crypto went offline.9) How much did you make off Trump's SPAC?Blank-check companies known as SPACs were once a little known way for companies to go public, but during the pandemic they became wildly popular. Former president Donald Trump used one called Digital World Acquisition Corp. to take his company, Trump Media & Technology Group, public. DWAC shares quickly became a meme and surged in value on the news.10) Can someone please explain to me what a DAO is?It's a decentralized autonomous organization, better yet, it's just a bunch of internet friends getting together to accomplish a goal. One DAO bought the secretive Wu-Tang Clan album once owned by infamous pharma bro Martin Shkreli. Another tried to purchase the Constitution but was outbid by Citadel Securities' Founder Ken Griffin. Now one is trying to buy an NBA team.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 23, 2021, 10:23 AM"

LUNA, the native coin of Terra’s blockchain, ranks 14th as per market valuation. Leading centralized exchanges like Deribit do not offer option contracts tied to these coins.“We bought AAVE calls at $360 strike price sold by Ribbon Finance on Nov. 12,” said Sit. He also serves as an advisor to Ribbon Finance and ThetaNuts Finance.AAVE is the native token of decentralized lending-borrowing protocol Aave. The cryptocurrency was trading near $310 on Nov. 12 and changed hands near $274 at press time.QCP also bought bitcoin and ether calls and ether puts via Ribbon Finance on Nov. 12, generating a notional volume of over $200 million, Ribbon Finance co-founder Julian Koh said in a Telegram chat.“Covered call,” an options-trading strategy that leans neutral to bullish, involves selling out-of-the-money (OTM) call options – those with strike prices above the current spot price – while owning the underlying asset. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and pays a premium to the seller for offering protection against a price rally.Story continuesRibbon Finance covered call strategyWith Ribbon Finance, the covered call strategy is automated. Investors need to deposit their AAVE into the vault, which takes care of other complexities like selecting the appropriate strike level for selling the weekly option.The vault sells weekly AAVE call options against 100% of deposits every Friday at 11 a.m. coordinated universal time in return for the premium (paid in AAVE) by buyers, mostly consisting of market makers. The premium received represents the yield from the strategy and is distributed to users in proportion to their deposits.If AAVE expires below the strike at which the call is sold, the depositors retain the entire premium received. If the option expires in the money with AAVE settling above the call strike, the option buyer can purchase AAVE at the strike price, and depositors lose money.DeFi options tradingBy and large, the recently launched AAVE vault functions similar to Ribbon’s ETH and BTC-covered call vaults discussed in depth in September.Structured products offered by Ribbon Finance and other protocols like StakeDAO and ThetaNuts Finance yielding double-digit returns are becoming increasingly popular as returns decline from so-called cash and carry strategies.“DeFi options vaults are the key to scalability for options and structured products on DeFi,” QCP’s Sit told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “We see this as the real DeFi 2.0 wave.”Ribbon Finance has registered a volume of more than $2 billion since the launch of the first option vault in April, Koh said. ThetaNuts is planning to launch option vaults for BTC, ETH, ALGO, AVAX, LUNA, SPELL and several other cryptocurrencies on Dec. 3, protocol’s manager told CoinDesk in Telegram interview.","November 23, 2021, 10:25 AM"

We want to be fully incentive-aligned to do this together, to build really powerful integrations that aren’t just surface-level, and that only happens when you’re working under the same token.”SynergiesOn a surface level, a merger makes natural sense.The two protocols are already closely aligned. Many of Rari’s lending pools accept both Fei’s stablecoin, FEI, as well as the project’s TRIBE governance token, and this usage has allowed Fei to put its foot in the door of a stablecoin market largely dominated by USDC, USDT and DAI.Story continuesHowever, both teams believe a deeper integration could boost these synergies significantly.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Rari’s Jai Bhavnani framed the merger as one that could bolster Fei’s usage and simultaneously enable immediate liquidity in lending pools – an all-in-one combination of liquidity and utility as a service that few other protocols could match. Both teams declined to speak to CoinDesk, pointing instead to communication in public channels.“The question should be, ‘How is this going to create a bigger entity than us staying independent?’” said Bhavnani on the community call. “Us verticalizing all of DeFi, products like FEI bootstrap becoming a priority – I think everyone should get hyped up for this, because it’s going to be a complete game-changer.”In his post on Rari’s governance forum, Santoro said that Fei can help Rari solve oracle availability bottlenecks, and that both projects will encourage usage for one another, as well as for exotic, long-tail assets in the DeFi ecosystem seeking to bootstrap liquidity.“As more pairs begin to form against FEI, the network effects grow for Fuse and FEI to list more assets and more pools with more utility for each,” he wrote. Fuse is a Rari protocol for creating permissionless money markets.Community reactionBefore this vision can come to fruition, however, the teams need to convince token holders to vote for it.In the hours after the proposals were first posted, the initial reaction from investors was decidedly mixed as each community expressed concerns the other could weigh token prices down.As part of the proposal, Fei would issue TRIBE tokens in exchange for Rari’s RGT tokens at a $1 to $1 rate, as well as pay off Rari’s debts related to a previous hack.Read more: Rari Capital Reports Exploit in ETH Pool; $15M Taken“I want further discussion on this topic. I really love Rari, but I am not sure how I feel about assuming Rari’s hack liabilities,” wrote one user on Tribe’s governance forums.Other Fei community gripes focused on the market cap for RGT relative to TVL compared with other lending protocols, potential TRIBE dilution and the rate of RGT/TRIBE conversion.Likewise, on the Rari forums, RGT holders expressed similar concerns.“This proposal is so heavily weighted towards TRIBE that this feels like a scam proposal,” wrote one investor.However, many third parties came out in support of the merger, applauding both the natural match between the protocols and the ambition to attempt one of the largest DAO-on-DAO acquisitions in history.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The teams both said that initial mutual distrust from token holders makes sense.“The gut reaction was, ‘My bags are great and I don’t want to mix them with any other bags.’ What we’ve seen is that neutral parties or people who hold both TRIBE and RGT are absolutely fucking stoked about this, and it’s people who have one or the other and don’t understand the other community – they’re asking hard questions and pushing back,” said Fei’s Santoro.Likewise, Bhavnani framed many of the concerns in terms of bagholder bias – a term for when crypto holders grow overly fond of the assets they hold and often behave in a cultlike manner.“Each of our communities are extremely cultlike – and that’s fucking awesome. People sharing their feelings, people sharing their concerns, that means these are strong communities that care about these things, and that’s the best thing a DeFi project can ask for at this stage,” the Rari founder said.Bhavani said that both teams don’t want to “trivialize” concerns and that he hopes to work with both communities to rally investors around to the vision of a DeFi superpower.Hierarchy and administrationMerging DAOs additionally comes with a number of questions concerning hierarchy, workflow and decision making.When asked about who would serve as the leader or de-facto CEO of the joint venture, both founders pushed back against the notion of needing a clear leader at all.“I think that’s a really unfair question. Neither of us is running the protocol – it’s a DAO, and a DAO is going to be made of teams and different core contributors. It’s based on context and on token-weighted voting,” said Santoro.In practice, DAO organizations without a leader can sometimes stumble – Synthetix founder Kain Warwick had to re-enter a leadership role for the synthetic asset protocol after stepping away earlier in the year.Nonetheless, the teams argued that DAO incentive structures would be enough to ensure an orderly transition.“We have this one financial instrument that value-aligns these two teams. Technically, we don’t even have to talk to each other – we just can keep our heads down and we’ll both be working to maximize value for the token,” said Bhavnani.The best example of what that might look like in practice is MakerDAO. The stablecoin protocol disbanded its legal entity in 2021, and is now run by semi-cloistered core units.In the absence of a unified vision, MakerDAO governance proposals are often hotly contested, however.While to some that rancor may be a sign of dysfunction, some DAO experts say that disagreements – even heated ones – can be healthy.“If there are disagreements, that’s governance – I think [Compound governance contributor Getty Hill] put it beautifully on a Compound governance call, ‘Votes are passing too much, too damn much,” said Santoro.Details and decisionsWhile the initial proposals in the governance forums were short and to the point, a host of teams have stepped in to help flesh out the details.“I think it’s a really novel idea for you guys to merge, and I was looking at this package of, ‘How does this work? What does this mean? How does this functionally occur?’” Hill, also the founder of crypto development lab GFX, said on the Thursday community call.Hill noted that the merger requires a “lot of social consensus,” and GFX spent a day drafting a DAO merger agreement, filling out at a high level what was lacking in the proposals. The firm is now playing a key role in fleshing out the details of the merger.“We’re just trying to fill in all the points that no one thinks of, doesn’t want to talk about, or aren’t addressed with what we think is the most neutral way to proceed. We’re just here to help this thing along,” Hill addedThe team plans to make this template available to the communities as they look to move forward.Likewise, Llama, a DAO tooling organization, has stepped in to address the pricing of the RGT/TRIBE token transfer.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.In a post in both governance forums co-authored by a number of contributors, Llama founder Shreyas Hariharan proposed a dual transfer method: a 14-day time-weighted average price for RGT’s conversion to TRIBE, and a yearlong vesting “success token” that would allow holders to exchange RGT for TRIBE 50% above the TWAP price after a year.Despite the many moving parts and dangling loose ends yet to be addressed, both founders continue to express optimism regarding the success of the merger.Should all the complications be untangled, the end result could be the most successful instance of a DeFi merger to date – a key step in legitimizing DAOs as competitive organizational entities, and a possible template for consolidation in a notably fractured industry.","November 23, 2021, 11:28 AM"

The debt figure did not include the bitcoin bond recently announced, the IMF added.Among the measures to limit contingent fiscal liabilities, the IMF recommended El Salvador consider winding down the $150 million trust fund created to facilitate the exchange between bitcoin and U.S. dollars. It also recommended withdrawing public subsidies to Chivo Wallet, a digital wallet launched by the Salvadoran government on Sep. 7.Regarding the country’s new payments ecosystem, the IMF said that El Salvador must immediately implement “stronger regulation and oversight.”Story continuesIt added that the Chivo Wallet should be required to safeguard funds — in U.S. dollars and bitcoin — “by segregating and ring-fencing reserve assets.”The banking regulation, for its part, should add prudential safeguards such as conservative capital and liquidity requirements related to bitcoin exposure, the IMF added.El Salvador also must analyze the reporting of bitcoin-related transactions to determine how the cryptocurrency affects the Salvadoran economy and to closely monitor risks, the IMF said.","November 23, 2021, 11:42 AM"

118,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-city-fantasy-201702237.html,The ‘Bitcoin City’ Fantasy,"This past weekend, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced plans for the world’s first “Bitcoin City.” The municipality will be set up like a tax haven for wealthy crypto investors – no income, property, capital gains or payroll taxes, only a 10% value-added tax (VAT) – and pay for its keep partially by net-zero, volcano-powered bitcoin mining. Construction will be financed primarily by a $1 billion bitcoin bond issued on Blockstream’s Liquid network, a Bitcoin sidechain. Here’s how that may play out.Bd. Buenos dias. A stream of sunlight filters in from the eastern window in the luxury co-op that I’ve taken up residence in. The building, like many others in “Bitcoin City,” which is situated on the Gulf of Fonseca at the southeastern tip of El Salvador, erupts from the ground like a lightning bolt – a jagged architecture in reference to one of the city’s primary benefactors, Jack Mallers’ Zap. There’s a remote control to lower the shades, but the batteries died ages ago and they’re hard to replace. Bitcoin is a battery, they said.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Today is the dedication ceremony of the Chapel of Jimmy Song, named for the bitcoin educator and patron saint of cowboy hats. It’s a modern church that towers above Satoshi Square, the central-most point of the city. From its bell tower, it’s said, you can make out the shadow of Solana Seastead, an experimental techno-kingdom floating 21 miles off the coast. We’re at war.Announced at the height of 2021′s “supercycle,” Bitcoin City is now half the age of the eponymous Bitcoin network. It’s the first and most developed crypto city, which isn’t saying much. Construction has been scattershot and slow going – more of a result of the competing interests of the municipality’s primary backers than of its unique financing. But we’re learning on the fly. The bitcoin bond, immediately graded “junk,” actually paid for itself – early investors are still getting a coupon payment.Story continuesSee also: Are El Salvador’s Bitcoin ‘Volcano Bonds’ an End Run Around the IMF? | The BreakdownWhat to build? Where to build it? An overriding commitment to the ideals of decentralization and self-sovereignty, and a lack of faith in the local government’s ability to allocate resources effectively, meant it was up for markets to decide. But finding consensus over the use of scarce resources is hard when the rules aren’t hard-coded. There’s plenty of money, but limited space and no zoning laws.Sure, there was a general architectural plan – a giant “b” bisects the city – but each building is a fiefdom of its own. People like it that way. Bukele’s government spent the proceeds of the $1 billion bitcoin bond to buy land and finance a conjoined, geothermal bitcoin mining facility and power station, but then the city mostly “decentralized itself out of existence.” That is, except for the state-run pet hospitals (it’s fine to throw the “Trojan horse” ruler a carrot).Promised residential areas, shopping centers, restaurants, “everything built around bitcoin,” we live with what the market provides. Some things are prioritized. Housing is either high-end or tiny, stacked hexagonal pods. There’s a McCafe on every block. It’s probably easier to buy a second passport than groceries. When the digital economy is paramount, and the population mostly globe-trotters, not many businesses can remain going concerns.Walking down the main thoroughfare of Bitcoin Boulevard, you’ll see holograms of Alexander the Great, Tony Robbins and Adam Back. There are a lot of figures who contributed to the city’s founding. A virtual projection of Bukele flickers outside City Hall, a neoclassical building cut out of orange and black stone. You can scan a QR code, deposit a satoshi or two, and he’ll tip his signature white baseball cap.

The only firms willing to buy distressed sovereign debt were the true believers – but as Blockstream’s Samson Mow said onstage at the “Feel the Bit” conference in 2021 – there are plenty of whales. But they all want a return on their tax-free investments.Although Bukele said, “Bitcoin City is committed to free and equal access to everything,” in practice that’s a little less true. Ideological libertarians may be willing to build a public library, but they’re less committed to public health care. The transient population, the limited VAT taxes actually collected and the lack of buyers for Salvadoran sovereign debt mean the country is living under austerity.I may sound pessimistic, but that’s only because you’re still living with the fiat mindset. A truly fair economic system recognizes that inflation is the greatest sin, that taxation is theft and that governments are hedonistic machines with a monopoly on violence. An economy based on scarce money makes sense for a world with limited resources, contrary to the last century of American hegemony.The startup cities that have been founded over the past odd decade present a new way for organizing the world. They treat citizens as customers, and what customers really want is a tax haven. It’s game theoretical, it’s inevitable, it’s as sure as the sun will set in the West.","November 23, 2021, 12:17 PM"

An absolute Mecca of food, music, fashion, and of course art, the area is home to the city’s most exciting venues, boutiques, restaurants, bars, and art galleries, serving up the best culture Southern Nevada has to offer. From the hippest bars like ReBar, which is a combination of a bar and antique shop where literally EVERYTHING is for sale, to the most delectable restaurants like Esther’s Kitchen, founded by Michelin five-star chef James Tree, the Arts District is the true cultural hub of Las Vegas. “Everything about the Arts District is independent and free-spirited,” says Trees. “Unlike the big hotels on the strip, where everything fits nicely into a theme, the Arts District is its own entity. That’s what makes it so fun and exciting.”You can shop for the most vibrant modern and vintage fashions at places like Glam Factory Vintage and Del’la Couture, or enjoy the best theater this side of Broadway at The Cockroach Theater or the Vegas Theater Company. Cocktail lounges like The Velveteen Rabbit and high-brow coffee shops like Makers and Finders are more New York Soho chic than Vegas Strip kitsch, and craft breweries like HUDL Brewing and Able Baker are making names for themselves by churning out the tastiest and most unique craft brews in the country. Popular venues such as Ninja Karaoke offer up a full throttle Tokyo karaoke experience, with themed rooms that are perfect for hosting your next birthday or business party, while trendy salons like The Atomic Lounge can give you the most stylish classic looks from the 1950s to today.Story continuesBut of course, what would the Las Vegas Arts District be without the art.You don’t even have to set foot in one of the district’s many remarkable galleries in order to peruse the murals that beautify the walls of almost every building in the area. Whether in search of a limited-edition print, the perfect piece to tie a room together, or the ideal artist to bring a custom commission to life, the Arts District’s galleries are treasures troves for both the casual and serious art lover alike. The Arts Factory is a sprawling converted warehouse that serves as home to the city’s most celebrated local artists’ studios, and Helios Fine Art is another renowned venue known for pushing boundaries and challenging the viewer.For those seeking vintage collectibles, furniture, knickknacks, and tchotchkes, Retro Vegas is a total time machine of Vegas kitsch, specializing in the best remnants of the bygone era. Still, perhaps the most exciting aspect of this burgeoning Vegas cultural phenomenon is their renowned First Friday events. On the first Friday of every month, the Arts District hosts a huge block party where the city’s best musicians, artists, food vendors, and clothing designers come together to showcase their trend-setting work. It is the best party in town. Although best known as a monthly event, the First Friday Foundation extends its community outreach efforts well beyond the first Friday of each month.As a non-profit organization, the First Friday Foundation serves to empower local arts, culture, and education through artistic opportunities for thousands of students in the Clark County School District. This directly aligns with TWO TWO’s own mission statement, to connect and enrich the global community through arts and entertainment. As the first immersive art gallery in the district, TWO TWO will become the touchstone from which all future galleries and art will emerge. So forget your tired old Las Vegas strip, and welcome yourself to the city’s best kept secret, located in the southern downtown within walking distance to Fremont St.“If you want to learn about history, you could read history books but that's a single perspective that may be tainted by class or politics,” according to Steven W Meistrich, Co-Founder and CEO of TWO TWO. “In my opinion, if you really want to understand and embrace history, one needs art, music and literature because that represents truth; the heart of a society, a generation, a culture. That understanding, offers a true sense of the meaning of history which is fundamental to the grown of humanity. Art, music and literature are not erudite. They are oxygen and it is incumbent upon us to educate.”TWO TWO, the City of Las Vegas, partners in Art Without Boundaries.ABOUT TWO TWOTWO TWO is the world’s first Interactive Art Gallery. It blurs the boundaries between physical and virtual art, exhibiting and selling the works of visionary, established and emerging graffiti, pop and street artists.

There are, however, ways to expose yourself to Ethereum without actually buying any tokens. These three look pretty interesting — one might be worth trying with some of your spare change.Coinbaseaskarim / ShutterstockAs the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Coinbase is in prime position to benefit from a rise in Ethereum trading, earning a transaction fee on every sale or purchase.Many cryptocurrencies sold on the exchange are powered by the Ethereum blockchain, which means a bet on Coinbase is essentially a bet on Ethereum itself. Their futures are tightly linked.One thing you want to see in any stock is a capacity for growth, and Coinbase has that in spades. In the second quarter of 2020, Coinbase had 1.5 million monthly users; a year later, that figure hit 8.8 million. Over that same span, net revenue grew from $178 million to $2.03 billion.Coinbase’s stock, currently trading for around $314, is down about 4% since the company went public in April.(And by the way, while many exchanges charge hefty commission fees to buy and sell crypto, some investing apps charge 0%.)Robinhood MarketsWachiwit / ShutterstockLooking at Robinhood’s stock performance since its IPO launched in July — it’s down more than 20% — you may wonder if the meme stock juice that the company was running on is fizzling.Story continuesIt’s a fair question, but Robinhood is not just a commission-free stock trading platform. The discount broker has facilitated Bitcoin and Ethereum trading since way back in 2018, and it now allows users to buy and sell Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.Robinhood’s crypto offerings have been paying off for the company too. Crypto-generated revenue in Q2 2021 was $233 million, more than 40 times what it was a year before.HIVE BlockchainCrypto mining farm | Mark Agnor / ShutterstockA cryptocurrency miner, HIVE Blockchain is one of the many companies that turn colossal amounts of computing power into crypto tokens. HIVE mines Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.The amount of energy required to mine cryptocurrency is creating environmental concerns among prominent investors, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and HIVE is focused on using green energy for its mining.HIVE has plans to pivot and focus on other cryptocurrencies once Ethereum 2.0 is rolled out, but its business is still heavily reliant on Ethereum and should provide decent exposure to Bitcoin’s little brother in the near to mid-term.HIVE investors have had a great 2021. The company’s stock has more than doubled in price since the beginning of the year.If any of these ideas interest you, know that you don’t have to start big. These days, you can build your own crypto-related portfolio just by using digital nickels and dimes.Avoid crypto volatility altogether—and still come out aheadKvitka Fabian / ShutterstockCrypto investing isn’t for everybody. The wild price swings and the many, many questions about its future as a currency make it a risky play in the short and long term.If the crypto market is a no-go for you, and you believe the stock market looks ready for a plunge, it might be time to get a piece of some real assets, like commodities or productive American farmland.Another option is contemporary art, which has solidly outperformed the S&P 500 almost every year since 1995.Investing in modern masterpieces doesn’t require millions of dollars. With the help of a popular new app, you can buy shares in rapidly appreciating works by Claude Monet, Andy Warhol and even Banksy.You won’t be able to gaze at them on your wall, but seeing them in your portfolio should be just as inspiring.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Three Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee -- Jon Tester (D-Mont.) Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) -- reportedly told the panel chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), in a call on Wednesday they would not support Omarova's nomination.According to Axios, John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) also oppose the nomination. Without the backing of all Democrats, it would be nearly impossible for Omarova to get confirmed in an evenly split Senate. ""The White House continues to strongly support her historic nomination,"" a White House official told the news outlet.""Saule Omarova is eminently qualified for this position,"" the official added. ""She has been treated unfairly since her nomination with unacceptable red-baiting from Republicans like it's the McCarthy era.""Senate Republicans have gone after Omarova, who was raised in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, for a past paper she wrote while at Moscow State University, saying it raises questions about her support for capitalism. ""She wants to nationalize the banking system, put in place price controls, create a command and control economy where the government allocates resources explicitly, instead of free men and women making their own decisions about the goods and services they want to buy and sell in an open market,"" Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.), the top Republican on the Banking panel, said at her nomination hearing. ""These are exactly the kind of socialist ideas that have failed everywhere in the world they've been tried.""Other Republicans called Omarova ""comrade"" while she was questioned at the hearing.Democrats have said Republicans are trying to paint Omarova as a communist sympathizer, with Brown saying the line of attack is a ""cruelty no person should experience.""""I grew up without knowing half of my family. My grandmother herself escaped death twice under the Stalin regime,"" Omarova said at the hearing. ""This is what seared in my mind. That's who I am.""The Hill has reached out to the five Senators reportedly opposing Omarova's nomination, Brown and the White House for comment. ","November 25, 2021, 5:57 AM"

Subscribe for free.Their opposition also hints at a willingness of some Democratic senators to buck the White House on an important nomination, even if it hands Republicans a political — and symbolic — victory.Republicans have attacked the Kazakh-born scholar in remarkably personal terms, and turned her nomination into a proxy battle over how banks should be regulated.Driving the news: In phone call on Wednesday, Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), all members of the Senate Banking Committee, told Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) — the panel's chairman — of their opposition.They're joined in opposing her by Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.).The five senators' offices either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Go deeper: Biden officials also have heard directly from the senators. They're aware of their deep opposition and know Omarova faces nearly impossible odds for confirmation.Still, they continue to back her publicly.""The White House continues to strongly support her historic nomination,"" a White House official told Axios.""Saule Omarova is eminently qualified for this position,"" the official said. ""She has been treated unfairly since her nomination with unacceptable red-baiting from Republicans like it’s the McCarthy era.""Omarova tried to salvage her candidacy during a hearing last week, where Republicans savaged her for her previous academic writings about how community banks should be regulated.Story continuesHer nomination, reflected in an ugly hearing in which Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) questioned whether he should call the native of the former Soviet Union ""professor"" or ""comrade,"" became a proxy battle.It split between the banking industry and progressives eager to impose more regulation on it.""The OCC charters, regulates and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations, as well as federal branches and agencies of foreign banks,"" it says on its website.The big picture: Now that the president has stared down progressives by renominating Jerome Powell for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, ideological fights between centrists and progressives about economic appointments are going to become more pronounced.Progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have already indicated they'll work to oppose Powell.Warren does support another Biden move, elevating Fed governor Lael Brainard to the vice-chair position.With centrists like Tester getting their preferred Fed candidate nominated for a second term, they may feel more emboldened to challenge the White House on lower-level nominations.Like this article?

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said consumers and investors may not understand how stablecoins work and the risks involved.“I have significant concerns with the non-standardized terms applicable to redemption of particular stablecoins, how those terms differ from traditional assets, and how those terms may not be consistent across digital asset trading platforms,” Brown wrote in his letter to Circle, the payment services company that operates stablecoin USD coin (USDC).After publication of this article, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted that he was looking forward to “responding and working with you to ensure consumers are appropriately protected.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Brown also sent letters to cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Binance.US, as well as blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos, which operates the USDP stablecoin; decentralized finance company TrustToken, which operates the TUSD stablecoin; and Centre, the Coinbase- and Circle-founded project that oversees the USDC stablecoin.The report compiled by the President’s Working Group, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is the first step toward establishing federal-level regulatory oversight of the stablecoin sector in the U.S.The regulators behind the report called on Congress to bring stablecoins under federal supervision. The report indicated that should lawmakers fail to do so, the regulators themselves may step in through the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which could designate stablecoin activities “systemically important” and thus subject to tighter supervision.Story continuesRead more: US Stablecoin Report Gets Mixed Reviews From Crypto IndustryStablecoins are cryptocurrencies typically tethered 1:1 to the value of other assets like the U.S. dollar, and issuers maintain the fixed value of these currencies by backing them with reserves that match the value of the coins in circulation.

This support level has already been tested several times and proved its strength. In case Bitcoin manages to settle below $56,000, it will likely gain strong downside momentum which will be bearish for the whole crypto market.Other cryptocurrencies are under pressure today. Shiba Inu has finally managed to settle below the support at the 50 EMA at $0.00004265 and declined towards $0.000039. Dogecoin moved to the support level at $0.22 after an unsuccessful attempt to settle above $0.2350. Solana pulled back towards the $216 level while XRP moved back below $1.05.It looks that crypto traders are waiting for clues from Bitcoin, which is stuck in the $56,000 – $57,700 range. In case the world’s leading cryptocurreny manages to get above $57,700 and develops upside momentum, other coins should also rebound.Technical AnalysisEthereum continues its attempts to settle above the resistance at the 20 EMA at $4,290. The bulls have quickly bought all recent pullbacks and pushed Ethereum back towards the 20 EMA level.However, the general crypto market sentiment has been mostly bearish in recent days, so Ethereum failed to develop sustainable upside momentum.In case Ethereum manages to settle above the 20 EMA, it will move towards the resistance at $4,535. A move above this level will push Ethereum towards the resistance at $4,650. In case Ethereum gets above $4,650, it will head towards the resistance at $4,770.On the support side, Ethereum needs to settle below the support level at $4,100 to have a chance to test the 50 EMA at $3,975. A move below the 50 EMA will signal that Ethereum is ready to develop additional downside momentum. In this case, Ethereum will move towards the next support at $3,715. In case Ethereum declines below this level, it will head towards the next support level which is located at $3,580.Story continuesFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Ethereum Pulls Back As Crypto Markets RetreatCrude Oil Rampages Past One Week HighPre-Thanksgiving Economic Data Puts the Greenback and the U.S Economy in the SpotlightElon Musk Disses Binance CEO on Dogecoin GlitchGold Bugs Face Danger From U.S Federal Reserve BankIMF Warns El Salvador Against Using Bitcoin as Legal Tender","November 24, 2021, 12:02 AM"

137,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rising-fees-avalanche-trigger-scramble-092052966.html,Rising Fees on Avalanche Trigger Scramble for Solutions,"Transaction fees are a touchy subject in crypto.First there was Ethereum, with simple trades on Uniswap going for over $100, as of Nov. 23, according to Etherscan. Now, in the wake of a weekend Twitter war in which transaction fees played a central role, users are reporting on the social network that fees on Avalanche, another Layer 1, are creeping up as well.“Avalanche transaction fees for swaps up to $20 tonight,” tweeted Eric Conner, co-founder of EthHub, the Ethereum information resource. Conner’s screenshot shows a transaction interacting with the router contract of Trader Joe, the decentralized exchange (DEX) on Avalanche.Fees for the contract have declined since then — they’re hovering in the $1.50 range as of Nov. 23, though swaps with transaction fees as high as $5 have occasionally appeared throughout the day.Two ReasonsKevin Sekniqi, COO and chief protocol architect of Avax Labs, which supports development on Avalanche, cited two reasons for the spikes in fees. The first is a 10M gas hardcap applied every 10 seconds, which Sekniqi told The Defiant is “an ultra-conservative measure that makes blockspace on Avalanche even scarcer than Ethereum mainnet.”Gas is a unit which measures computational effort required for transactions on the blockchain. So the gas limit is how much computation effort is available in a given timeframe. As demand for computation on a blockchain goes up, given a fixed gas limit, transactions get more expensive.“As blockspace is consumed within these 10 seconds, the fees aggressively ratchet up to prevent the rapid creation of blocks in a very condensed time period to spam the networking layer,” said Sekniqi. The ratcheting up is a unique mechanism to Avalanche and leads to temporary spikes in fees, according to the protocol architect.The second primary factor driving up fees is MetaMask, the crypto wallet, which has struggled to estimate Avalanches fees due to the unique mechanism, said Sekniqi. The protocol architect said that the gas limits will be removed following the introduction of something called superpruning, which essentially allows some of the blockchain’s history to be discarded. “It’ll be much faster and cheaper than Ethereum on apples to apples,” Sekniqi said.Story continuesCrypto Maxi, a pseuodonymous investor and developer, is skeptical of how much superpruning will help lower fees. “Pruning directly doesn’t influence scalability,” they told The Defiant.While it’s unclear how much superpruning help lower transaction fees, Sekniqi does say that Avalanche will need a technology called subnets to get “infinite scalability.”Subnets are a horizontal scaling strategy that can validate Avalanche blockchains running in parallel.SuperpruningThere too, Crypto Maxi is skeptical. “Subnets do not share security unlike Polkadots parachains,” they said. “Technically they will help Avalanche scale the same way as if there would be a bunch of Matic-type chains launched around Ethereum.” The developer concedes subnets are superior to sidechains.Overall, Sekniqi is optimistic about the combination of superpruning, subnets and other optimizations, saying that “together, [the technologies] will dramatically increase the scalability of Avalanche, and thereby the broader DeFi ecosystem as it grows out of the crypto niche and into mainstream.”Crypto Maxi thinks the breakthroughs haven’t happened yet. “Nothing offers orders of magnitude performance increases, unless we talk about stuff like zkRollups etc,” the developer said.There’s no doubt that Avalanche is attracting users at a rapid rate. The platform hit an all-time high of 669,756 daily transactions on Nov. 21, according to block explorer Snowtrace.Daily transactions on Avalanche’s c-chain. Source: SnowtraceThat’s more than half of the mark Ethereum hit on the same day — the world’s largest smart contract platform had 1,260,939 transactions on Nov. 21.Of course, both platforms could tweak their parameters to increase scalability and lower transaction fees, but that means there will be more expensive hardware requirements for the nodes processing the transactions, which dampens decentralization.In all, it’s setting up to be a battle for the ages.Read the original post on The Defiant.","November 24, 2021, 1:20 AM"

So-called whale transaction counts, or the number of SHIB transactions valued more than $100,000, have been rising since the beginning of November. Active deposits, or the amount of daily unique addresses to deposit SHIB to centralized exchanges, have also been increasing.Large valued SHIB transactions vs. SHIB's price. (Santiment)A spike in the active deposit metric may indicate a rise in short-term sell pressure for the token, according to Santiment’s metric explainer.“Like any asset, SHIB price is the product of supply and demand ... a larger percentage of SHIB buyers were evidently attracted by its speculative appeal alone,” Rick Delaney, a senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. “Drawn by the asset’s rising price, many SHIB investors simply do not have the long-term conviction needed to hold their positions or to reenter the market while the price is dropping.”Falling trading volumeWhile SHIB was once the most traded token on centralized exchanges, its trading volume has dropped significantly, as CoinGecko’s data shows.Story continuesNansen said that trading volume is among the most important metrics for SHIB and other meme tokens because a drop in trading volume shows that investors start to lose interest and become more “cautious” of putting money in the meme-themed tokens.The most traded alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on centralized exchanges now are gaming-related tokens, including decentraland (MANA) and the sandbox (SAND), according to CoinGecko.“SHIB’s price fall can be mostly attributed to the recent shift in investors’ interest from meme tokens to metaverse projects,” crypto price-tracking site CoinMarketCap wrote in a response to CoinDesk. “That can easily be seen by comparing the trading volume of MANA, SAND and SHIB.“Trading volume is always related to investors’ interest in a project,” it added.Social media buzz around the canine-themed coin has also sunk dramatically. At the time of publication, Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge retail interest in trending topics, showed a value of 22 for the search query “SHIB” globally, down from a peak at 100 at the end of October.A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time. A value of 22 means fewer people are scanning the web for information on SHIB.Silver liningDespite declining social media buzz around the meme token, retail investors’ interest in SHIB remains strong as the number of unique addresses holding SHIB continues to increase – good news for the SHIBArmy.The number of unique addresses holding SHIB surpassed one million on Nov. 11 – a time when SHIB’s prices were already dropping, according to Nansen data.“Retail interest is definitely there still, as people take speculative bets,” Daniel Khoo, research analyst at Nansen, said. “[No one] wants to miss out on getting rich.”","November 24, 2021, 11:19 AM"

Bitcoin’s use as legal tender “also gives rise to fiscal contingent liabilities” the IMF added.The international financing institution, which reviews the fiscal, monetary and external position of its member states annually, recommended “narrowing the scope of the Bitcoin law” and “strengthening the regulation and supervision of the new payment ecosystem”.The IMF said that El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s announcement of a $1B “bitcoin-bond” over the weekend had not been discussed in its meetings with the government. But the Article IV concluding statement cautioned that the government’s plans would “require a very careful analysis of implications for, and potential risks to, financial stability”.El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tenderIn September, El Salvador adopted bitcoin as its second form of legal tender to go alongside the US dollar. The dollar has been the country’s main form of money since it ditched its old national currency, the colón, back in 2001 after two decades of double-digit inflation.El Salvador thus became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, as a form of legal tender, creating excitement in the crypto community and drawing ire from critics in equal measure.With bitcoin now a form of legal tender, economic agents are legally mandated to accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment for services unless some form of technical impediment exists. The El Salvadorian government introduced a new e-wallet called Chivo which facilitates both US dollar and bitcoin transactions, as well as conversions between the two, and is backed by a $150M government trust fund.On Saturday, President Bukele announced that El Salvador would build the world’s first “bitcoin city” at the base of the Conchagua volcano, where bitcoin mining would be powered by geothermal energy and there would be no taxes, aside from VAT. The city would initially be funded by the issuance of a $1B bond, the proceeds of which would be invested into bitcoin, a so-called “bitcoin bond”.Story continuesIMF recommends stronger regulation, oversight“Stronger regulation and oversight of the new payment ecosystem (the Chivo e-wallet) should be immediately implemented for consumer protection, anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), and risk management”, the IMF recommended in its statement on Monday.“Banking regulation should incorporate prudential safeguards such as conservative capital and liquidity requirements related to Bitcoin exposure”, the group added. “Measures to limit fiscal contingent liabilities, such as winding down the trust fund or withdrawing public subsidies to Chivo, should also be promptly considered”.Bukele’s announcement of a new bitcoin city backed by bitcoin bonds has not been able to turn the tide for BTC/USD, which continues to trade heavily on Tuesday in the mid-56,000s. For now, support at in the 55,700 area is holding up well, but the cryptocurrency continues to post lower intra-day highs, signaling the likelihood of a downside break. That would open the door to a test of support in the form of the mid-October lows in the 54,000 area and then at the 7 September high just under 53,000.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Accenture Continues to Attract Big MoneySilver Price Daily Forecast – Silver Remains Under Pressure As Dollar Gains More GroundBig Money Fuels WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings GrowthWhy Gap Stock Is Down By 23% TodayRipple CEO Believes SEC Case will be Concluded Next YearGold Price Forecast – Gold Trying to Break Through Major Uptrend Line","November 24, 2021, 3:55 AM"

The company also announced that it would be delisting Tron’s TRX.“The regulatory landscape for crypto is evolving rapidly… As a result, we will be limiting the ability for US users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX” a spokesperson from eToro told Business Insider.The surprise delisting triggered selling in ADA. The cryptocurrency now trades more than 5% down on the week, with its market cap having tumbled from above $61B at the start of the week to under $58B as of Thursday.As of the 26th of December 2021, eToro US users will no longer be able to buy the cryptocurrency. Then, after the 31st of December 2021, users holding ADA will no longer be able to earn staking rewards.In a video response to the decision, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, blamed the decision on a lack of regulatory clarity and played down the impact the delisting would have on ADA’s price in the long term.He explained that European-based exchanges like eToro tend to limit their US exposure, given that US exposure comes with high regulatory costs. US-based exchanges like Coinbase, which are already paying for US regulatory compliance, have an easier in the US, he added.About Cardano and its Cryptocurrency ADACardano is an open-source, decentralised blockchain platform that achieves consensus using proof-of-stake and can facilitate internal transactions using its cryptocurrency ADA.It was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, and was initially funded through an initial coin offering (ICO). In 2017, Cardano launched its crypto-currency ADA.Story continuesADA is the largest cryptocurrency (by market capitalisation) to use a proof-of-stake blockchain. Proponents of proof-of-stake blockchains argue that it is significantly more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.Back in February, Hoskinson estimated that the Cardano network used just 0.01% of the energy used by the Bitcoin network.ADA Back Sharply from September’s Record HighsADA surpassed $3.0 in September, taking its gains on the year at the time to more than 1700%. Since the all-time highs printed two months ago, however, the cryptocurrency has seen a sharp correction.As of Thursday, with ADA trading in the mid-$1.700s, the cryptocurrency is down more than 40% from its prior record highs. But the cryptocurrency still trades with on-the-year gains of more than 800%.As regulatory concerns build and the broader crypto market continues to struggle, further profit-taking may see ADA drop back towards the next key area of support in the $1.0 area, which would amount to a further 40% correction.But between April and July this year, the $1.0 area proved to be a profitable area for short-term buyers on four different occasions. There is every chance this buy-the-dip mentality could return.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Trying to RecoverWTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+USD/JPY Price Forecast – US Dollar Continues to Press Ever so HigherTesla Shares Rally Despite Musk Selling Over $1 Billion of His StakeAUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis – Taking Out .7170 Could Trigger Acceleration into .7106Natural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Quiet During Holiday Trading","November 25, 2021, 5:50 AM"

Dubbed the “crypto sprint,” the agenda sketches out a to-do list for 2022 that will offer crypto players more clarity on the rules of the road, and comes as the industry is moving to shape the debate.“Cryptocurrencies didn’t grow big because of this lack of protection or lack of regulation. Binance has grown to be the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the crypto industry because we protect our users and the users trust us,” Zhao told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.Like its more U.S. focused competitor Coinbase (COIN), Binance has recently laid out its own recommendations for crypto oversight, in the form of a bill of rights for cryptocurrency investors.“We believe it should be up to each nation’s policymakers and their constituents to decide who should have oversight over the industry,” the bill states.While he admitted that cryptocurrency is still nascent, Zhao added that “I think the industry has grown to a point where there are many smaller players who are less protective of their users and we would like to see more regulation in the space so the retail consumers are protected.”Big profits, governance headachesBitcoin's taken another leg lower since setting a fresh record on November 10.Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has earned record-breaking profits this year as cryptocurrencies surged when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) cracked a new all time high earlier in November, hitting levels just below $69,000. The notoriously volatile digital coin market has had a rough week, with Bitcoin shedding over $10,000 from its record. Zhao insisted his company was wrapping up its latest round of funding “in about a month or two,” as he tries to smooth over Binance's friction with regulators, who are trying to make sense of the asset class — and provide effective investor protections.Story continuesMeanwhile, the exchange’s U.S. subsidiary, Binance.US, has seen a revolving door of three different CEOs this year alone. Catherine Coley was replaced in April by the former acting head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks — who left to head the crypto infrastructure and banking company after only a few months on the job.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.More recently, Binance.US promoted Brian Shroder to CEO and hired Amjad Qaqish — another former regulator from the IRS’ Criminal Investigations unit (IRS-CI) — to lead its compliance division. Amid the executive turmoil, the exchange's token, Binance Coin (BNB), has become the third largest cryptocurrency after BTC and ethereum (ETH-USD).

So much so that the singer and reality star shared a throwback clip from her family show, “Braxton Family Values.”“Where are the freakin chitterlings for God’s sakes?!” Tamar wrote in the caption of an Instagram post on Tuesday, Nov. 23. “How can there be Thanksgiving without them!! Please help us @trinabraxton1 and I need em BAD.”The funny clip features Tamar, her mother, Evelyn Braxton, and her sister Towanda Braxton shopping at the grocery store.“Tamar, you for real gonna’ eat chitlins?” asked Towanda asked in the video before Tamar responded, “Yes, girl, you for real not?” Towanda countered with, “No, that’s disgusting.”“Chitlins are a good way to bring a family together, even though they stank a little bit.

157,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consensys-suddenly-bars-iranian-students-160453000.html,ConsenSys Suddenly Bars Iranian Students From Ethereum Coding Class,"ConsenSys, the Ethereum software powerhouse, removed about 50 Iranian students from its online programming course in a move that highlights the gray areas in sanctions law facing the cryptocurrency industry.The students were notified on Nov. 13 in an email from ConsenSys Academy, an educational branch of the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based company. While they already finished most of their coursework, the suspension means students won’t receive certificates of completion.“We are saddened to have to tell you that, effective immediately, we are suspending your enrollment in ConsenSys Academy and your access to the platform,” read the email, which two students separately shared with CoinDesk. It was sent at 1:30 a.m. local time in Iran. “A recent review of our records shows that you indicated that you are located in a country that we are prohibited from providing goods or services to under U.S. law.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The move represents an abrupt turnabout for ConsenSys, which had offered the $985 course to Iranian students for free and in the past talked openly about its scholarships for Iranian women.It’s unclear what triggered the company’s drastic change of course. Elo Gimenez, ConsenSys’ global public relations lead, would say only: “ConsenSys is committed to building the digital economy of tomorrow and also to complying with U.S. law in all its facets. That commitment is reflected in our terms of service.”The switch underscores the latent tension between sanctions, a policy tool to isolate rogue regimes, and blockchains, decentralized networks unconstrained by geographic borders. While sending money from the U.S. to Iran is clearly prohibited, simply teaching citizens of a sanctioned country to use censorship-resistant technology is a more ambiguous matter.The suspensions come two months after Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in a sanctions case brought by the U.S. over a speech he gave at a conference in North Korea. Griffith was previously expected to fight the charge in court.Story continuesLong-tense relations between the U.S. and Iran were further strained this month after two incidents in the Sea of Oman.ConsenSys has been raising money over the course of 2021: The VC-backed entity got a fresh $65 million in April and $200 million in November, with mainstream finance heavyweights such as Mastercard, HSBC and UBS among the investors.Whatever the reason for ConsenSys Academy’s decision, it left the students, who lost access to the course materials a few weeks before the program’s scheduled ending on Dec. 1, frustrated and bewildered.“We are not entering a genuinely new world, but we are just witnessing a transition of our old institutional relations, which are the relations of inequality and power, to just new forms and institutions,” one of the students, Salman Sadeghi, a researcher at the College of Dublin in Ireland, wrote in an emotional blog post.Recent college graduate Mohammad Hosein Ahmadzadeh told CoinDesk that being abruptly cut off from ConsenSys Academy felt like a bitter deja vu: websites like Coursera and GitHub have previously restricted access for users from Iran.“Especially when [Donald] Trump was president, Iranians couldn’t use these sites,” Mohammad added. “We can’t access any education sites with Iranian IP or nationality.”Gray areaWhen asked whether, as a general matter, sanctions bar U.S. companies from teaching blockchain programming to Iranians, a Treasury Department spokesman said: “this isn’t something answered by a simple yes/no.”“We’d need to really have an extensive compliance discussion with the company itself in order to make any kind of assessment,” said the spokesperson, Morgan Finkelstein, declining to comment further.Sanctions experts interviewed by CoinDesk gave differing opinions on the risk of violating sanctions for U.S. companies that provide education to Iranians and the potential severity of any penalties.While education is normally not subject to the sanctions the U.S. imposed on Iran, there are some intricate caveats, said Benjamin Hutten, counsel at the law firm Buckley LLP.For example, it’s only legal to provide learning materials that are a complete product, available in full from the start. This means that “it would probably be permitted to export books, pre-recorded courses or lectures,” but not teach a live lecture, for example, via Zoom, because it “would not be fully in existence at the time of the sale,” Hutten said. (ConsenSys Academy’s course included live content, according to a person familiar with the program.)It’s easier with traditional learning formats, when to study with an American teacher one needs to go through the emigration process and effectively get approved as a foreign student by the U.S., Hutten said. Accredited academic institutions, like universities, can provide remote courses to Iranian students if those students previously had a U.S. student visa and the coursework was part of regular degree studies, Hutten said.“If a company can keep [its] crypto educational activities within the above constraints, there should be relatively low risk in doing so,” he said. If not, the consequences can be either a significant monetary penalty or even criminal charges for a willful violation, Hutten said.Given the exemption under sanctions law for informational materials, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) “has not been in the habit of publicly penalizing companies providing education or educational materials to Iran, and it certainly has not imposed severe penalties in this sphere,” Hutten said.However, the agency “has discretion to make the penalty fit the circumstances, and thus to the extent that the information or education could be or is used to violate or evade stations, the penalties could be more severe.”Read more: ConsenSys AG Shareholders Readying Legal Action Over Share ValuationDaniel Tannebaum, a former OFAC officer and partner at the Oliver Wyman consulting firm, told CoinDesk that the language of sanctions laws can be confusing to people who don’t regularly deal with them, and “confusion about potential non-compliance can force businesses to abandon what could potentially be lawful activities.”Although the case of Virgil Griffith apparently scared people in the industry, Tannebaum said he believes that spreading knowledge about blockchain technology and digital assets is not damaging, but helping what the U.S. is trying to achieve in Iran.“Blockchain and digital assets may benefit the government of Iran, but they also benefit the Iranian population in breaking out of their existing banking system as they try to look for more freedom, assuming broader sanctions relief,” Tannenbaum said. “That being said, the sanctions are still heavily in effect. So if you find that you’re dealing with someone who is physically located in Iran, that is a sanctions-related risk.”The safest way to proceed for a company would be to reach out to OFAC and ask for specific guidance, “but you might not get a specific answer,” Tannebaum said.According to Amber Scott, founder and CEO of Canadian consulting firm Outlier Solutions, the risks for American companies providing services to countries under U.S. sanctions are quite real.“The U.S. has a stricter sanctions regime than other countries, as well as more severe consequences for violation,” Scott told CoinDesk. “It’s correct for institutions to take a cautious approach.”When it comes to technology, even giving people knowledge about circumventing the sanctions regime, which cryptocurrencies can do, can be considered a violation, Scott said. The case of Virgil Griffith definitely made the blockchain community in the U.S. stop and reconsider their approach to interaction with sanctioned jurisdictions, she added.Hope still lingersEarlier this year, ConsenSys Academy’s team seemed excited about educating Iranians, who often find themselves excluded from the global IT market. Last year, a group of seven Iranian women got a chance to study Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, for free thanks to ConsenSys Academy grants.The project was put together with the help of a local crypto association CoinIran. It was meant as “a diplomatic mission to give this opportunity to folks who need it,” as Coogan Brennan, then head of developer relations and now director of ConsenSys Academy, told CoinDesk in February.This year, the program was expanded so that 50 students from Iran were enrolled in September. Since then they all but finished the course and had been working on their final projects when the news came of their suspensions.Thessy Mehrain, a ConsenSys alumna and one of the creators of the program for Iranian students, said that Iran has a lot of tech talent, and people with coding skills should be able to contribute to development of Web 3 – a future decentralized internet – regardless of where they are geographically.“Those are the same people who can work on a world that works better for everyone, because we build technology that helps to collaborate, build reliable reputation and verify transactions,” Mehrain wrote to CoinDesk in a Twitter direct message.For Iranians, crypto provides a way to find jobs and earn money outside the country.“Because of sanctions, in Iran we can’t buy things, transfer money, participate in classes or have a bank account outside of Iran, and I think blockchain can help us to solve part of this injustice,” said Ahmadzadeh, the recent graduate.Read more: Here’s What We Know About Suex, the First Crypto Firm Sanctioned by USSome of the students are still hoping the situation can be resolved. As a temporary fix, students who live in other countries and did not choose Iran as their country during registration still can access the course, course participants interviewed by CoinDesk said. They are sharing the content with others so that people can finish their work, said one of the students, Navid Hosseini, who works as a developer at a crypto exchange he wouldn’t name.However, it won’t help students get official certificates from ConsenSys, which could provide “a springboard” for Iranian blockchain coders, Hosseini said.“I have known ConsenSys for many years for their products like MetaMask and Infura and I have known that they are one of the leading companies in the blockchain sector,” he said. “So, attending and passing this course was crucial for me and many other students that I know.”Reza Ghasemi, a cryptography professor at Bu-Ali Sina University in Iran, wanted to learn smart contracts coding so he could pass that knowledge on to his students, he said. That, in turn, would give them better career opportunities.In the end, Iranians are still enrolling in PhD programs abroad, he added, and he himself has been working on academic projects with colleagues in Canada and Turkey – although he doesn’t want to publicly name the academic institutions so as not to cause problems for them.He added he still hopes that the program’s mentors, which are the previous year’s students, can negotiate some solution with ConsenSys so that this year’s students finish their projects and get their certificates.Ghasemi said he believes the company gave in to pressure from overly cautious lawyers.“I believe that ConsenSys doesn’t like to do that, to ban us,” he said.","November 24, 2021, 8:04 AM"

With momentum around the metaverse growing daily, the tokens attached to the virtual world have soared in the last week.The biggest catalyst has been social media platform Facebook changing its name to Meta in late October, in a nod to the company's commitment and focus on building out its own metaverse - the next step in the evolution of online life.Sandbox, a Hong Kong-based gaming platform, has recently drawn in millions in funding, including from backers like SoftBank, as it gears up to launch its play-to-earn metaverse capabilities. The company said last week it would open up part of its metaverse from November 29.Its sand token has shot up by almost 100% in the last week, and was up 24% on Wednesday to trade around $6.81 by 07:30 a.m. ET. Sandbox visitors can monetize assets and gaming experience, including buying virtual plots of land, all with the sand token. Even German sports apparel maker Adidas said it is toying with the idea of building in the Sandbox metaverse.Big names have already jumped into the metaverse. Snoop Dogg announced in late September he would be buying a plot of land on Sandbox to build a mansion and will release his own non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which will give people VIP access to concerts and events on the platform.""We're seeing major movements in the metaverse currencies, as knowledge about 'play 2 earn' projects increase, and major institutional players hop on the train,"" Nicolai Qvale Fredriksen, analyst at Arcane Research said.Story continuesPlay-to-earn earn projects, where players earn digital coins as rewards, have become massive this year. Axie Infinity, an NFT-based online video game featuring cute cartoon axolotls, has seen its token triple in value in the last two months alone.Sandbox said on Twitter last  its Alpha hub would go live November 29 and would allow people to step into its metaverse for the first time and earn NFTs, as well as up to 1,000 sand tokens.""It will be very interesting to see how sand performs after the launch, and I will be surprised if the price drops below $6 again, given the already strong belief from the market,"" Fredriksen said.Decentraland, the virtual world where people can buy and sell digital real estate, has also drawn in some big backers.The Metaverse Group, a real estate company that is focused on the metaverse, announced on Tuesday that it had completed ""the largest metaverse land acquisition in history"" according to a statement. The company acquired 116 parcels of land ""in the heart of the Fashion Street district"" of Decentraland worth $2.5 million.Decentraland's mana token also got a boost from the surge in sand, and has gained almost 60% in the last week, and was last up 27% on the day at around $5.25 on Wednesday.""When it comes to mana, I believe the movement is due to a positive correlation with sand. If sand continues its boom, so will mana,"" Fredriksen said.Meanwhile, the more traditional cryptocurrencies, even so-called meme tokens like dogecoin and shiba inu, have been in a bit of a lull by comparison. Bitcoin has lost almost 7% in the last week and was last around $56,658, up around 0.6% since Tuesday.

The roadmap also covers settling and executing trades, loans backed by crypto assets, issuing stablecoins, tax services and whether to hold crypto assets on the balance sheet.The agencies also will assess applying bank capital and liquidity requirements for holding crypto assets, noting that they’ll continue to consult with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on capital requirements.The Basel Committee, part of the Bank of International Settlements, sets global standards for banking regulations. They’ve proposed two groups of capital requirements, including that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin should be subject to a higher risk weighting of 1250%.Yet large banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank oppose this capital level, calling it too conservative and could stop banks from being involved in the crypto market.The agencies stated they’ll continue to monitor developments in crypto-assets and may address other issues as the market evolves.Story continues“Regulators are promising actions that could probably impact decentralized finance and crypto trading,” says Jaret Seiberg, analyst with Cowen & Co. “It is broadly supportive of our view that regulators plan to treat crypto solutions the same as the product it is trying to replicate.”Officials are laying out their initiatives in the crypto space after the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets issued recommendations recently on how to regulate stablecoins, tasking regulators with using their current authorities to regulate the sector. That’s now being translated to all of crypto.OCC weighs inAs the regulators sketched out a broad outline of their plan to offer clarity on which crypto activities are legal for banks, the OCC, which oversees national banks, is clarifying that national banks and federal savings associations can engage in cryptocurrency activities — if they get approval from regulators. Few banks are engaging in crypto right now, but for those that aren’t, and want to do so going forward, will have to earn the agency's seal of approval.The OCC says banks must demonstrate to regulators that they have proper risk management controls in place before they can deal in crypto. The agency said on Tuesday that institutions need to address risks of cryptocurrencies, including hacking, fraud, and theft, liquidity risk, anti-money laundering, sanctions requirements, and consumer protection laws for the agency to determine whether they can deal in crypto safely. After receiving approval, only then can the bank engage in crypto activities.The OCC believes that providing cryptocurrency services is a modern form of traditional banking, and that banks are authorized to perform. Among permissible activities, the OCC has previously determined and is reiterating banks may hold deposits that serve as reserves for stablecoins that are backed on a 1:1 basis by a single fiat currency, and held in hosted wallets. Banks are also allowed to use distributed ledgers and stablecoins to help facilitate payments—that includes buying, selling, and issuing stablecoins to enable payments.“Providing this clarity will help ensure that these cryptocurrency, distributed ledger, and stablecoin activities will be conducted by national banks and federal savings associations in a safe and sound manner,” Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu said Tuesday. “This will provide assurance that crypto-asset activities taking place inside of the federal regulatory perimeter are being conducted responsibly.”As industry players stake out positions and try and influence the debate, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao said the cryptocurrency exchange wants to help regulators better understand the space, and offer proper protection to investors.“It’s always a subjective judgement,” Zhao told Yahoo Finance. “I think crypto definitely, compared to stock markets, is still much more nascent. I think the industry has grown to a point where there are many smaller players who are less protective of their users and we would like to see more regulations in the space so the retail consumers are protected.”Meanwhile, the vacancy for the vice chair of supervision on the Fed's Board of Governors could hold implications for crypto regulations. Senator Elizabeth Warren said the role “must be filled by a strong regulator with a proven track record of tough and effective enforcement - and it needs to be done quickly.” While regulators are putting their ideas out in a crypto sprint, President Joe Biden's pick for that position will get to influence the final outcome.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRead the latest cryptocurrency and bitcoin news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Flipboard, and LinkedIn","November 24, 2021, 9:40 AM"

To the downside, support in the mid-55,000 area has been supporting the price action. To the upside, a downtrend linking the 10th and 12th of November lows and 16th, 18th, 20th, 21st and 22nd November highs have been capping the upside.Given BTC/USD’s continual printing of lower highs despite support in the 55,500 area holding firm, the price action has been getting squeezed. As is typically the case with bearish triangles, a bearish break in the short-term is the most likely scenario. Should such a break occur, bitcoin bears would likely target a move to the next area of key support just under 53,000, a high from early September.But if the bulls hold firmConversely, should the bulls stave off a break below the mid-55,000s and instead force a break above the recent downwards trendline, a move back towards the 50-day moving average around 60,500 would be on the cards. Just this month, the 50DMA has already proven a key level to watch, providing strong support to the price action back on the 17th of November, only to then offer solid resistance once prices had broken lower on the 20th and then 21st of November.Further complicating the quest of the bulls to return BTC to its recent record levels at 69,000 is the presence of the 21DMA in the mid-61,000s, slightly above the 50DMA. Above that, there is then more resistance in the form of 10th and 12th November lows in the 62,000s. A near-term break above all of these levels of resistance might prove challenging, with bitcoin instead opting to consolidate within the 55,500-60,000ish range it has carved out for itself in recent days.A dip to the September low a buying opportunity?It might reasonably be asked whether, in our more bearish scenario where the descending triangle breaks to the downside, ushering a push lower to support around 53,000, presents a buying opportunity for BTC. Indeed, since May, BTC has demonstrated the beginnings of a pattern where it consolidated within a range for a few months, then broke to the north of this range, then fell back to test the top of the old range, then pressed higher again. Who’s to say a drop back to the top of BTC’s August to early-October 41,000-53,000ish range won’t see the pattern repeat itself once more.Story continuesFurthermore, bitcoin’s 14-day Relative Strength Index current, which currently sits just above 40.00, would probably fall under 30.00 in the scenario where BTC drops all the way back to the 53,000 area. Whilst this hasn’t historically been the best short-term buy signal, it has successfully signalled that selling pressure may soon run out of steam and that trading conditions ahead are set to be more consolidative.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Silver Price Prediction – Prices Fall on Dollar StrengthSilver Price Forecast – Silver Markets StabilizingNatural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Testing 50 Day EMAFirst Trust Mid Cap Value AlphaDEX ETF is Still Strong Despite Recent DipWhy Gap Stock Is Down By 23% TodayS&P 500 Price Forecast – Stock Markets Quiet Heading Into Thanksgiving","November 24, 2021, 9:53 AM"

Bitcoin, for its part, dropped 14% on WazirX and just 0.5% on Binance, the article said. Tether, a stablecoin, also sunk on the exchange while remaining steady elsewhere, Coindesk reported.A proposed law in India is seeking to ban all private cryptocurrencies, likely causing the price declines on the local exchanges.The price drops opened up an opportunity for investors to buy the dip and profit elsewhere. According to CoinDesk's report, arbitrage opportunities in India are mainly helpful for small-time investors because bigger market makers avoid the country for lack of regulatory clarity.But the trick was figuring out how to transfer funds to a different exchange after purchasing the assets at a lower cost, Bloomberg said. And it's not easy. WazirX tweeted out that it was experiencing trading delays in the app, and frustrated users responded that they could not move their crypto. Several hours later the company said the problem was fixed.""We'd like to reiterate that WazirX has an open order book and doesn't determine or control the price of any crypto on the exchange,"" the platform said in a tweet. ""There will always be a difference from exchange to exchange, country to country, etc. depending on the demand and supply.""Crypto arbitrage opportunities have been well documented, as the prices can vary between exchanges. A 2017 Insider article noted the issue stems from the market being ""diffused, unregulated, and disjointed.""Read the original article on Business Insider","November 24, 2021, 10:44 AM"
173,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/el-salvador-needs-imf-bitcoin-185039310.html,El Salvador: Who Needs the IMF When You Have Bitcoin?,"Christopher Nolan’s third Batman film, “The Dark Knight Rises,” is generally considered the weakest entry in the series, in part because it’s so easily read as a celebration of neoliberal authoritarianism. The film’s plot has the villain, Bane, take over Gotham City, wipe out all financial ledgers and reign over a kind of mega-Occupy movement. To fight back, Batman engages in a series of moral compromises that he justifies as, more or less, necessary exceptions to defend a more broadly just system.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.The International Monetary Fund has been playing the Batman role in the global order for decades. Though nominally aimed at supporting democracy and free markets, reforms mandated by the IMF in exchange for its loans have historically included serious cuts to social spending and industrial policy. The fallout is often devastating: The IMF’s (real world) body count is considerably higher than Batman’s.El Salvador, a country with low income and high debt, has been in negotiations with the IMF for one of its loans in the amount of $1.3 billion. One roadblock has been the country’s recent adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF signaled it wasn’t too happy with that idea.On Monday, El Salvador introduced a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” that could present at least a partial end-run around the IMF, highlighting why bitcoin made the IMF so queasy in the first place. “The Dark Knight Rises” contains a notorious moment, drawn from the Batman comics, in which Bane pummels Batman so badly that his back is broken, leaving him paralyzed and vulnerable. That’s about how the IMF is going to feel if El Salvador finds a way to raise large sums of international financing, as a developing country with a troubled economy, without the IMF or corruption-riddled global banks.Story continuesThe bond allows purchases in units of $100, using bitcoin or tether. It will be issued by Bitfinex, an essentially stateless and unregulated platform. So there are probably few if any controls on who can buy into this bond, either by source or by amount.That means one simple thing: El Salvador will absolutely sell out of this bond, and will probably be able to issue another round. It will replace that $1.3 billion from the IMF without breaking a sweat, even taking into account that about half of the first bond sale will go into a bitcoin fund.There doesn’t need to be any further explanation of this than “Bitcoiners are nuts and rich,” and would gladly pump money into this small country for the lulz. More seriously, every one of these experiments that pans out is another win for bitcoin, so pitching in is also a matter of enlightened self-interest. Remember that an Ethereum DAO just raised $40 million for what was essentially a vaguely civic-minded prank – $1 billion for an actual bond with an actual return is nothing.Let’s leave aside the touted “Bitcoin City” El Salvador says it wants to build using the other half of the first bond. That’s mostly a marketing stunt: For $500 million, at best the country will get a couple of power plants, a server farm and an IHOP. And that’s actually fine! Assuming El Salvador follows through in broad strokes, you do need some kind of infrastructure to support the mining facilities, so whether or not it’s a “city” right off the bat is a matter of semantics. And $500 million of new capital in the small country will have a major impact regardless of how it’s spent.Read more: The ‘Bitcoin City’ Fantasy – Dan Kuhn So, kudos to El Salvador for burning down Wall Street and building a throne out of the skulls of predatory bankers. That said, the bond might not be a terribly great investment.For one thing, it introduces political counterparty risk to your bitcoin strategy. This is a country that only emerged from near-anarchy in 1994, and while President Nayib Bukele seems to have sturdy popularity, a disruptive change in leadership or the political order could mean creditors don’t get paid back. That’s not necessarily likely, but it’s on the table in a way that it’s not with, say, U.S. Treasury bonds (or just buying bitcoin yourself).Also, Blockstream’s projection that the bond will return 165% annually over 10 years is based on the bet that bitcoin will be trading at $1 million by that time. I consider that completely possible, but also completely unknowable. A 10-year projection for literally any asset is pretty much always going to be a made-up number. Invest accordingly – unless your real priority is to change the world.","November 24, 2021, 10:50 AM"

That, and other increasingly ambitious plans to put bitcoin at the center of its economy, are wagers that America’s global influence is waning.“I know the concerns here in D.C. are about losing the power of the dollar and we can understand that, but El Salvador has to move on [because] it wants to be on a different level,” Mayorga said. El Salvador adopted the U.S. dollar as legal tender in 2001 after the failure of its native currency, the colón.Concerns about El Salvador’s monetary experiment are widespread. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged El Salvador to strengthen the regulation and supervision of bitcoin use in the country, noting the “significant risks” that come with the cryptocurrency.El Salvador will be closely watched in 2022. Besides its recently announced “Bitcoin City,” a low-tax, legal municipality pitched as a mecca for wealthy bitcoin investors, the Central American country plans to raise $1 billion via a bitcoin bond, a tokenized financial instrument in partnership with Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream.Although no other country has yet to follow El Salvador in putting bitcoin on equal footing as the U.S. dollar, many are beginning to think seriously about digital currencies. Neighboring Honduras and Guatemala, for instance, are both studying central bank digital currencies.Read more: Paraguay Proposed Bitcoin Law Includes Crypto Registration: ReportSo far, the Biden administration has been mum about what’s happening south of the U.S. border. “We have to have the conversation, but we are an independent country, so [the U.S. has] to accept our movement and understand that we want to take ourselves to a different level and with a definitional system,” Mayorga said.","November 24, 2021, 11:23 AM"

The caretaker said Mr. Goxx showed no signs of serious illness, and fell asleep peacefully on Monday morning.Mr. Goxx captured the internet's imagination over the summer as it placed trade after trade for various cryptocurrencies in its hamster trading office, which consisted of a wheel of intention, buy and sell decision tunnels, and various sensors and cameras.Since it began trading on June 12, Mr. Goxx posted a career performance of 19.7%, nearly double the S&P 500's return of 10.9% over the same time period.The hamster's last trade was selling 3,229.4 tron tokens on November 20, which proved timely given the cryptocurrency plunged nearly 10% this week after eToro said it would delist TRX from its platform for US investors.The top three holdings of Mr. Goxx's portfolio were stellar, ether, and chiliz, according to the hamster's last livestream video.The success of Mr. Goxx allowed his caretaker to raise more than $12,000 from the sale of Goxx Capital- themed NFTs. The proceeds funded a larger trading portfolio for the hamster, as well as the construction of a bigger and better trading rig, according to an October interview with Insider.For now, the idea of continuing the crypto trading project with a new pet is of no relevance to the caretaker as they mourn the loss of Mr. Goxx.Story continues""Thank you and rest in peace, Max (a.k.a.

Mana is Decentraland's cryptocurrency, which users employ to buy and sell assets in the virtual space.Tokens.com said it would use the ""116 parcel estate in the heart of the Fashion Street district"" of Decentraland for expansion into the digital-fashion industry.To be sure, homes in the US finance and tech capitals are still pricier on a per-square-foot basis.One parcel of land in Decentraland is equivalent to 52.5 square feet.

This is likely due to more speculative interest in the options market for ETH relative to BTC.As shown in the chart above, “when implied volatility (options market expectations of future volatility) is substantially higher than realized volatility (the actual price fluctuation during past trading ranges), an increase in the latter is usually around the corner and long volatility options positions pay exponential returns,” Two Prime wrote.Altcoin roundupSHIB slumps as large holders take profits: Shiba inu, the self-proclaimed “dogecoin killer,” may still have its passionate following but it was in the red again Wednesday following three consecutive weeks of losses.

With 5.44 trillion MEX set to be distributed over the course of a year, the value of the program currently sits at $7.32 billion worth of incentives – likely the largest liquidity mining program in DeFi history, assuming prices remain stable.Additionally, in an interview with CoinDesk, Elrond Network CEO Beniamin Mincu said that an initial airdrop of MEX tokens to Elrond EGLD token stakers helped to bootstrap usage.“With 60,000 users who could claim MEX based on their EGLD holdings before go-live, the Maiar DEX had an impressive Day 1 user count, which keeps increasing,” he said.Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum is ahead of Elrond in TVL at $2.35 billion, and Waves is 11th with $1.5 billion. The Ethereum mainnet leads all chains with a commanding $171.9 billion – well over half of DeFi’s aggregate $260 billion in value managed by various protocols.As the competition heats up between layer 1s to attract users and funds, projects are increasingly turning to massive incentive programs to stand out. Harmony, Fantom, Avalanche and Oasis are a few of the leaders who have turned to the tactic or are planning to, but so far not at Maiar and Elrond’s scale.Mincu said that Elrond currently has functioning cross-chain bridges to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom and Tron, and that more DeFi verticals will be coming to Elrond in the coming months, including lending and synthetic assets.","November 24, 2021, 2:06 PM"

The U.S. investment bank is one of the several banks which have recently raised their interest rate hike expectations for 2022 to three from two.Minutes of the central bank's Nov. 2-3 policy meeting showed that various policymakers said they would be open to speeding up the taper of their bond-buying programme if high inflation held and would move faster to raise rates.(Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Editing by Tommy Wilkes)","November 25, 2021, 2:49 AM"

DeFi. The mainnet beta of Cronos, an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, went live on Nov. 8.Cronos is built on the Cosmos SDK and utilizes a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism. Being EVM-compatible, it allows for the easy porting of applications from Ethereum. It also supports the Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol, which provides a bridge to the Cosmos ecosystem.Total Value Locked (TVL) on Cronos has reached $954M in the two weeks since it launched.TVL is dominated by VVS Finance, a decentralized exchange (DEX) forked from Pancakeswap, which accounts for $700M, or 73%.The rapid growth is remarkable given that there is currently no working bridge between Cronos and Ethereum or any other blockchain. Users can only move assets to Cronos from the Crypto.com exchange and the company’s Crypto.org blockchain.It will be interesting to see if Cronos continues to gain traction once fully integrated with the rest of DeFi. A bridge to Ethereum is expected soon, according to the official bridge website.Sparing No ExpenseCrypto.com has been ramping up its marketing efforts in recent weeks.In October, it kicked off an ad campaign featuring Hollywood actor Matt Damon.That was followed by a $700M naming rights deal for Los Angeles’ Staples Centre, which will now be known as the Crypto.com Arena.Prospective builders on Cronos can apply for grants from a $100M EVM Fund that’s offering up to $1M per project.Disclosure: The author holds a small position in CRO and is farming VVS tokens.Read the original post on The Defiant.","November 25, 2021, 1:46 AM"

The price volatility may rise as major exchanges, including Deribit, are due to settle monthly options on Friday.The three-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts relative to calls, has turned positive, hit a 6-week high of 3%, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.The positive number shows that put options are drawing higher prices or demand than calls or bullish bets. At the start of the month, the three-month gauge stood at -5%, indicating a bullish bias.The one-week and one-month put-call skews have seen similar ascents this month and are signaling bearish bias with above-zero prints. The six-month put-call skew has turned neutral.A positive skew does not necessarily mean traders are taking outright bearish bets rather they could be adding downside protection against long positions in the spot or futures markets.In any case, it indicates fear in the market, which is warranted, given bitcoin’s 16% fall after hitting a record high of $68,990 on Nov. 10.Concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) may chalk out a faster end to its two-year stimulus program and the resulting strength in the dollar appear to have driven the cryptocurrency lower. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, has increased by 3% since the hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data released on Nov. 10.The Fed began cutting back on the monthly bond-buying program from this month and stands ready to accelerate the unwinding of stimulus if things continue to heat up. Minutes from the November Fed meeting released on Wednesday shows that policymakers were willing to raise interest rates if inflation continues to rise.So, the dollar may remain strong in the coming weeks, keeping bitcoin gains under check.Options expiryData provided by Skew shows a total of 51,900 options contracts worth nearly $3 billion are due for expiry on Friday. About $2.5 billion worth of options will be settled by Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange, at 08:00 am UTC.Story continuesThe majority of open interest is concentrated in call options at strikes above bitcoin’s record price. The max pain, or the price level at which option buyers would suffer the most loss on expiry, is $58,000.According to a theory, the max pain acts as a magnet while heading into the expiry as option sellers, typically large institutions, buy or sell the underlying asset to keep the price around key levels to inflict maximum loss on buyers.While there is no evidence of sellers using such strategies in the bitcoin market, the cryptocurrency has, in the past, moved in the direction of the max pain point ahead of expiry and gained strong directional bias after the settlement.So, the prospects of a big move in the next day or two cannot be ruled out, more so, as volumes are likely to be thin due to the Thanksgiving holiday.Bitcoin was last seen trading near $58,200, representing a 1.8% gain on the day.","November 25, 2021, 2:37 AM"

The play-to-earn platform said in a tweet on Wednesday that a piece of land had sold for 550 ether, worth over $2.3 million at current levels. Axie Infinity allows users to create digital pet axolotls to play games, buy land and other asets and win and sell axie-related non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It even has its own cryptocurrency - AXS - which is one of the most traded among metaverse-linked tokens.""We believe this is the largest sum ever paid for a single plot of digital land,"" Axie tweeted.Prior to this latest sale, the project's biggest sale was worth 888.25 ether for nine plots of land, which amounted to over $1.5 million at the time it was sold in February.Axie Infinity, which was created by Sky Mavis, a Vietnam-based company, is one of the biggest non-fungible token platforms in the world.NFTs are unique digital tokens that are a big part of the growing metaverse platform. Mark Zuckerberg's Meta - formerly Facebook - will be focusing on creating this virtual reality, as will Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who recently raised funds to build out their own metaverse.Another property sold for $2.43 million on rival platform Decentraland on Tuesday. Both these price tags are higher than those for most real-life homes in some of the US's most expensive cities.The growing momentum in the metaverse has also fueled steep rises in the value of the cryptocurrencies that are linked to the virtual world.

Developers find it hard to provide basic privacy features to their users without breaking the bank.However, the DeFi ecosystem is growing, and new solutions are emerging to boost adoption for both the developers and the users.Panther Protocol Raises More Than $32 MillionPanther Protocol, an end-to-end privacy solution that creates privacy for DeFi and Web3 users across public blockchains, has announced that it has raised $22 million in a public sale event. Thus, bringing the total amount raised by the team to $32 million.According to its official website, Panther Protocol is an end-to-end privacy protocol for DeFi. Panther provides DeFi users with fully collateralized privacy-enhancing digital assets, leveraging crypto-economic incentives and zkSNARK technology.The Panther team said the funds would be used to build an interoperable privacy layer for the decentralized finance space and web 3.0. Panther Protocol’s CEO Oliver Gale told FXEmpire that “The raise was a humbling moment for us all. Our team executed the public sale flawlessly and barely took a breath to issue quiet congratulations before continuing with business as usual and preparation for our token generation event. This year will see a groundbreaking privacy innovation for launching protocols privately, and in a decentralized fashion, an incentivized testnet followed by a v1 protocol release taking us in the holidays.”By raising funds via a public sale, Panther Protocol is offering the opportunity for wider community engagement and participation in an end-to-end privacy protocol for DeFi and Web 3.0 users.At the moment, the Panther team is building on numerous blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Flare, Songbird, NEAR, and Elrond. In addition to developing APIs, SDKs and custom integrations, Panther will enable decentralized application developers to provide privacy features within their apps. Hence, eliminating the need for highly specialized cryptographers and privacy tech engineers.Story continuesThe DeFi Ecosystem Continues to GrowThe DeFi space remains one of the fastest-growing in the cryptocurrency industry. Recent reports have indicated that the total value locked (TVL) across DeFi lending protocols surpassed the $230 billion mark earlier this year.The space is expected to grow even bigger over the coming years, and Panther Protocol wants to play an important part in the sector. Panther Protocol co-founder Anish Mohammed concluded that “As with duality of light, privacy has a dual nature, we are in the history of privacy where we are just reconciling, privacy’s dual nature. Panther protocol has managed to allow both privacy and authenticity by combining zero-knowledge proof systems and selective disclosures.”This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Is Dogecoin Ready For A Short Squeeze?WTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+Tesla Shares Rally Despite Musk Selling Over $1 Billion of His StakeAUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis – Taking Out .7170 Could Trigger Acceleration into .7106SAND Soars Over 260% In November While Metaverse is on FireEUR/USD Mid-Session Technical Analysis for November 25, 2021","November 25, 2021, 7:37 AM"

The exchange told Insider the rapidly shifting regulatory landscape was behind its decision to limit the ability of US customers to open new positions in the two digital currencies.Many critics have argued that the regulatory landscape in the US for crypto is not clear yet but officials do believe that regulation is necessary and more policies are set to be put in place by 2022.Hoskinson, who founded cardano in 2015, said that he still needed further clarification on the trading platform's decision to delist ada for US customers.""There's currently nothing we've received, no regulatory event, no subpoena, nothing from any regulatory agency, no threats of lawsuits, none of these things, that's why we're so blindsided by it, because actually, the trend has been over the last six months a significant increase of liquidity on cardano,"" Hoskinson said.""On our side, we had no indication of this from eToro and it's rather unfortunate that nothing was sent our way,"" he said.The decision knocked almost 4.8% off the value of the ada token and sent it to three-month lows, while trx fell 5% to a one-month low on Wednesday,Story continuesBut ada has still been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of 2021. It's gained around 850% so far this year, which has made it the world's sixth largest digital token by market value, according to Coinmarketcap. It's fallen short of the 14,000% gain in rival solana's sol token this year, but has roundly beaten bitcoin's 102% rally.It's a smaller competitor to the ethereum network, thanks to its capability of hosting smart contracts and other applications that are key to decentralized finance.Cardano's ada has been listed by some of the biggest exchanges. It was listed on Coinbase on March 19 this year and on Binance in 2017, and Kraken listed it in 2018. Bitstamp decided to list ada last Thursday. The altcoin is not listed on Gemini yet.""We at least could have better understood the reasons and we'll of course reach out on our side to better understand reasons but it's primarily the foundation's responsibility,"" Hoskinson said, referring to the Cardano Foundation, a non-profit organization in Switzerland that is the custodian of the Cardano brand.While eToro's decision came as a surprise, Hoskinson was ultimately sanguine.It doesn't surprise me from the perspective of these things happen. Everybody has a different compliance desk. Everybody has a different regulatory tolerance. Everybody has a different customer base,"" he said.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 25, 2021, 8:02 AM"

It is up almost 40% in the past seven days.The token of the decentralized virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain now has a reported market capitalization of $9.2 billion, according to data provider Messari. The surge pushes it ahead of metaverse related play-to-earn game Axie Infinity’s AXS, which has a reported market cap of $8.6 billion.Tokens tied to the so-called metaverse, or shared virtual environments, have surged since October, when Facebook said it was changing its corporate name to Meta to signal an increasing focus on the sector. At the time, Decentraland’s market cap was just over $2 billion.“Investors are still wanting to capitalize on the narrative of the metaverse since the rebranding of Facebook,” said Juan Pellicer, an analyst at IntoTheBlock.Pellicer said that the recent waves of transactions for MANA of over $100,000, could be signalling institutional demand.He also noted that the recent virtual real estate plot sales are putting Decentraland in the spotlight again, which could also be helping propel the price.Reuters reported on Monday that a Tokens.com subsidiary, the Metaverse Group, bought a patch of virtual real estate in the Decentraland metaverse for 618,000 MANA – equivalent to around $3.2 million at the time of writing.Other gaming and metaverse related tokens are also trading upwards. On Monday, Sandbox’s SAND reached record highs after Adidas teased a partnership between the two companies.Axie Infinity’s AXS is up 15% in the last 7 days trading to around $140 per token.“Gaming is still very much at the forefront heading into Sandbox’s alpha release on November 29,” said Denis Vinokourov, an independent crypto analyst.Sandbox, which is owned by Hong Kong based game software company, Animoca Brands, announced this week that it will open up part of its metaverse via its multi-week play-to-earn Alpha event on Nov. 29. The event will give users the chance to earn up to 1,000 SAND and exclusive NFTs.","November 25, 2021, 8:46 AM"

200,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-gift-keeps-giving-charity-175034763.html,Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity),"Manuel Gonzalez Alzuru, a co-founder of a soon-to-launch non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, says he is “doin’ good,” with a smile and a nod over a video call. “It never gets old saying that.” His platform, boyishly named DoinGud, is what Alzuru calls a “prosocial” experiment – a way to funnel some of the massive profits generated by the emergent NFT economy to worthy causes.“Ethereum gave me freedom,” Alzuru, 31, said. “And I’m always looking for ways to give back and to get some freedom for others as well.” That’s a message he thinks others in crypto could get behind. DoinGud, set to launch on Nov. 30, distinguishes itself from the increasingly crowded field of NFT markets by automatically directly a percentage (5%-95%) of sales to charities.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.For an industry that prides itself on working on behalf of the “public good,” outright philanthropy isn’t often prioritized. Companies, projects and individuals have made breathtaking profits this year during a bull market that has driven the entire market cap of all cryptos, at times, above $3 trillion. It’s money that’s sometimes literally printed from nowhere and might be put to good use.“In order for you to give, you need to have something to give,” Alzuru said. NFTs have unlocked untold fortunes for a number of artists across industries – seemingly regardless of experience or, at times, talent. The “creator economy” was well underway in 2018 when the ERC-721 white paper was published, describing the smart contract standard underpinning NFTs. Since then, however, NFTs have extended the playing field of who can get paid for their work online.That’s at least part of what Alzuru means when he says “freedom:” Crypto has given him more than just financial “independence” (though there is that): It hast also granted him the lowercase-l, liberal freedoms some people in North America or Europe may take for granted. Born in Venezuela, Alzuru said he felt he had no guaranteed right to speech or expression, until he found Ethereum.Story continues“I’m able now to express myself on Ethereum, on the internet, and it stays there,” he said. “No one can take that away from me.” That’s the power of property rights enforced by code, he said. But don’t confuse him with any old capitalist; Alzuru, perhaps like Ethereum itself, is ideologically fluid.“I also believe in communal property rights, ‘public goods’ or public infrastructure,” he said, invoking the idea that crypto, open and accessible to all in theory, is a new type of digital commons. That’s ultimately what he wants DoinGud to become, to exist at the protocol level, a tool that other NFT or DeFi platforms can integrate to automate charitable giving.But public goods are open to exploitation. Or, as street artist Rich Simmons put it in an email, “The whole NFT and crypto climates so far have felt like a bit of a cash grab.” Simmons is joining the ranks (including publications like CoinDesk and The New Yorker) of those using NFTs to fund charitable giving. He’s using a platform called HistoryMakr and donating to several mental health organizations.Give crypto to get backIs crypto charity a way to cover up some of the evils of the industry? Under fire for its environmental footprint, rampant scams and general social toxicity, crypto certainly needs a little goodwill.See also: Want Cleaner Bitcoin Mining? Subsidize ItBut “corporate social responsibility,” the idea that traditional businesses owe something to the world in addition to their shareholders, often leads to less-than-desirable and sometimes hysterical results. It’s the same mentality that has the Central Intelligence Agency whitewashing itself as a progressive wing of government.At launch, creators on DoinGud will be able to determine which causes to support and what percentage is handed over. The intention is to open source its code and form a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to set protocols around charitable giving. “Consensus is also always changing,” Alzuru said, and six-member founding team isn’t comfortable determining what is “right or wrong.” A “curated” registry, launched in collaboration with The Giving Block, an established project that enables charities to accept crypto, may eventually blacklist unsavory recipients.Regardless of people’s motivations for giving, there’s a huge opportunity for charitable efforts to thrive in crypto. Blockchain has long been touted as a way to bring transparency to an industry that sometimes operates in the dark. Smart contracts, like the ones DoinGud designed, can make giving a routine part of doing business. Not to mention the wealth, the insane wealth, created during bull markets.Alzuru even thinks the psychological effects that transparent blockchains foster, the same mental forces that drive people to display NFTs as avatars on social media, could benefit charity. “With crypto, you have this proof that you’ve given back to the community,” Alzuru said, referring to the paper trail left on Ethereum. “Most of the time, [when giving], people are showing us vanity.”“You might want to create something for the betterment of humanity,” he said. “What you need to first think about yourself, like if you’re not good, if you’re not doing good yourself, you cannot be creating stuff for others.”","November 25, 2021, 9:50 AM"

High inflation is driving fears that the Fed could pull the trigger on higher rates soon. Already, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has gone from 0.93% in January to 1.64% today.Here are five high-growth, high-profit-margin stocks Goldman has found to brace your portfolio. At least one could be a lucrative pickup, especially if you’re investing for free.Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA)PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / ShutterstockMarathon is a cryptocurrency miner. Year-to-date, its mining fleet has produced approximately 2,516 self-mined bitcoins.And while some bitcoin miners might be tempted to sell their coins in the recent crypto rally, Marathon simply hoards them — an act known as “holding on for dear life,” or HODL, to crypto enthusiasts.Unsurprisingly, the stock did well in the crypto boom. Year-to-date, Marathon shares are up an incredible 362%.The stock came up in Goldman’s screening process because the consensus estimate for its annual revenue growth is 105% from 2021 to 2023. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for its 2023 profit margin is 51%.Riot Blockchain (RIOT)Morrowind / ShutterstockRiot Blockchain is another crypto play that showed up in Goldman’s search. It mines bitcoin and hosts mining equipment for institutional clients.In Q3, revenue totaled $64.8 million, up a staggering 2,532% year-over-year.But Wall Street believes the best is yet to come. The consensus annual revenue growth projection is 69% from now till 2023, with the profit margin reaching 46%.Story continuesShares have already more than doubled in 2021.Of course, there are many ways to jump into the crypto boom. For instance, some apps allow you to pick up crypto ETFs or buy cryptocurrency directly, all commission-free.Marvell Technology (MRVL)Raimond Spekking/Wikimedia CommonsChipmakers are firing on all cylinders right now, and Marvell Technology in particular is receiving plenty of investor attention.Its stock has surged 57% year-to-date.Thanks to growing demand from data centers — Marvell’s largest end market — the company’s revenue grew 48% year-over-year to $1.076 billion in its most recent fiscal quarter.Going forward, Wall Street expects the company’s sales to grow at an annual clip of 20% in the next two years, with a profit margin estimated at 35%.MP Materials (MP)RobSt / ShutterstockMP Materials is a rare earth mining company that billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya helped take public through a SPAC last year.The company owns and operates Mountain Pass, the only integrated rare earth mining and processing site in North America.Shares are up 49% year-to-date.One of the reasons behind the investor enthusiasm is that electric vehicles (EVs) need powerful rare earth magnets to turn energy into motion. Given the growth rate in the EV industry, MP’s outperformance shouldn’t come as a surprise.The company is expected to deliver annual revenue growth of 50% through 2023.Mastercard (MA)garmoncheg / ShutterstockIn terms of market cap, Mastercard is bigger than all the previously mentioned companies combined.While smaller companies tend to be more nimble, the financial services giant can also deliver rapid growth, especially as pandemic restrictions are being lifted.In Q3, Mastercard’s gross dollar volume rose 20% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Cross-border volume, on the other hand, surged a more impressive 52%.Analysts expect the company’s revenue to increase at an annual clip of 18% in the next two years.Yes, Mastercard does trade at over $330 per share at the moment. But you can still get a piece of the company using a popular app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.A fine strategy further afieldSeventyFour / ShutterstockOf course, you don’t have to limit yourself to the stock market.There are real assets that have survived all kinds of interest-rate environments while also delivering market-beating returns.For instance, contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart.Investing in fine art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra rich. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks, too, just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

The Fed's ideal annual rate of inflation is roughly 2 percent, but the bank recently adopted a strategy that called for allowing price and wage increases to run slightly higher to make up for more than a decade of sluggish growth. Even so, inflation has risen higher and stayed at elevated levels for much longer than Fed officials expected earlier this year.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who was renominated this week by President Biden, is among several bank officials who've warned against raising rates abruptly to halt inflation that is driven in large part by the pandemic. Yet a growing number of Fed officials have called for the bank to start pulling back on stimulus at a much faster pace.The Fed announced after the November meeting that it would reduce its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage bonds by up to $15 billion, but did not commit to raising rates sooner. Further increases in the inflation rate could prompt the Fed to accelerate its tapering of bond purchases, which began in March 2020 to keep financial markets flowing amid the onset of the pandemic.","November 24, 2021, 11:31 AM"

207,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-says-fed-may-accelerate-110611395.html,Goldman Says Fed May Accelerate Tapering in January: Report,"Having kicked off the unwinding of the crisis-era stimulus this month, the U.S. Federal Reserve may accelerate the pace of the tapering next year, according to a Bloomberg report, citing a client note from Goldman Sachs.The central bank will double the pace of scaling back its liquidity-boosting asset purchases to $30 billion per month from the current $15 billion, Goldman economists said, predicting three rate hikes in 2022 and two in 2023.The new projections mean the asset purchase program would end in March.The investment banking giant expects the first rate hike from near zero will come in June.“The increased openness to accelerating the taper pace likely reflects both somewhat higher-than-expected inflation over the last two months and greater comfort among Fed officials that a faster pace would not shock financial markets,” economists led by Jan Hatzius noted.The Fed cut rates to nearly zero and began purchasing assets worth $120 billion per month following the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020.The massive liquidity injections led to unprecedented risk-taking across all corners of the financial market, including bitcoin.Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting released Wednesday showed a growing number of policymakers were ready to speed up pace of the taper and raise interest rates if inflation continues to run high.Faster unwinding of stimulus, if any, may weigh over bitcoin, which remains vulnerable to fed tightening, and asset prices, in general. The cryptocurrency fell almost 7% on Friday amid a massive pullback in the financial markets as concerns over a new coronavirus variant damped risk appetite.Read more: Bitcoin Slips to $55K as Renewed Covid Concerns Jolt Traditional Markets","November 26, 2021, 3:06 AM"
208,https://yahoo.com/news/why-ethereum-is-gaining-traction-in-cryptocurrencys-horse-race-181618921.html,"Ethereum outshines Bitcoin in cryptocurrency horse race, price may have further to run","Ethereum (ETH-USD) is defying broad underperformance in cryptocurrencies, with its recent price gains reflecting a surge of interest in smart contract platforms that are being rapidly co-opted by the nonfungible token (NFT) boom. Amid newfound investor interest, the digital coin's performance has even eclipsed Bitcoin’s (BTC-USD), which has languished for over a month after setting a new record high near $68,000.Currently trading around $4,400, Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Like Bitcoin, ETH has morphed into something of a reserve currency of its own for crypto investors. That also might mean headwinds for the asset over the longer term, not to mention an opportunity for competing blockchains.Unlike BTC, which is most often used as speculative store of value like gold, ether's primary use is to provide fuel or gas for transactions across the Ethereum blockchain.“As the price has gone up, it's gotten very expensive to get any [transaction] space on a block on the Ethereum blockchain,” Aaron Lammer, a decentralized finance (DeFi) specialist at the crypto-focused quantitative hedge fund, Radkl, told Yahoo Finance. “There's still a huge number of people waiting to be on-ramped into DeFi and NFTs, we might see the price of Ether go even higher, and really only become available to people who are using it in a large-scale institutional way,” Lammer added.As Lammer explained, one consequence of high fees is that projects and users have a financial incentive to drop Ethereum for less expensive smart contract-enabled blockchain alternatives such as Solana, Avalanche and Terra.By no coincidence, the tokens for these competing chains behind smaller digital coins like Terra (LUNA1-USD), Avalanche (AVAX-USD) and Solana (SOL1-USD) have also performed well over the last month.Terra token has doubled in the last week, surpassing Shiba Inu coin (SHIB-USD) as the 12th largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $25 billion. Story continuesSimilar to Ripple (XRP), the token's creator, Terra Labs, is also at the center of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commissions investigation working to determine whether some of the world's top cryptocurrencies are, in fact, securities. At least for the moment, ETH isn't suffering from similar regulatory uncertainty. However, ETH's developer team has initiated a coin supply burn in its August upgrade, which will continue to exacerbate transaction costs — and potentially cause its value proposition to better fit large institutions who can afford to pay the fees.""Applications, like within DeFi, are competing for institutional capital, which is less concerned about high fees due to the more nominal sums of money they transact,"" explained Mason Nystrom, a research analyst with Messari.Data tracked at watchtheburn.com, a project supported by the Ethereum Foundation, shows the rate at which burnt ETH has risen since Ethereum's upgrade. The net supply (block rewards issued - burned ETH) has dropped 80% from August through November.The stakes of DeFiAs Lammer pointed out, another reason for Ether’s rising price can be attributed to investor interest in DeFi. The emerging sector lets investors reap lending yields that are making regulators nervous, and causing Wall Street to salivate over how to tap the market.“A lot of DeFi is based on the idea of individual investors supplying capital into decentralized marketplaces,” Lammer explained.“Except when you make a swap, you're actually in a pool that people have contributed money to, and therefore get rewarded in tokens. Other services are lending platforms, where you could lend your Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or all sorts of tokens in exchange for a percentage paid in APR [annual percentage rate],” he added.Such financial apps might seem harrowing to some investors, but the yields for lending assets within DeFi exchanges and protocols, range anywhere from 15% to 45% annual percentage rate (APR). For context, that's exponentially higher than what Americans can earn for holding U.S. dollars in a savings account (0.04% according to the FDIC).In October, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler told Yahoo Finance that DeFi is ""going to end poorly"" unless protections are bolstered for those who invest. The agency has already acted on the premise that lending products from centralized crypto companies also need to be registered as securities.Meanwhile, attackers have stolen more than $700 million dollars in this year alone, with the latest exploit coming at the expense of DeFi autonomous organization (DAO), also known as BadgerDAO. The crypto hack may cost the organization $120 million, according to one of its members.David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

It fell as low as $41,967.5 during the session, taking total losses for the day to 22%.The broad selloff in cryptocurrencies also saw ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, plunge more than 10%.Based on cryptocurrency data platform Coingecko, the market capitalisation of the 11,392 coins it tracks dropped nearly 15% to $2.34 trillion. That value had briefly crossed $3 trillion last month, when bitcoin hit a record $69,000.The plunge follows a volatile week for financial markets. Global equities and benchmark U.S. bond yields tumbled on Friday after data showed U.S. job growth slowed in November and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus kept investors on edge.Justin d'Anethan, Hong Kong-based head of exchange sales at cryptocurrency exchange EQONEX, said he had been watching the increase in leverage ratios across the cryptocurrency markets as well how large holders had been moving their coins from wallets to exchanges. The latter is usually a sign of intent to sell.""Whales in the crypto space seem to have transferred coins to trading venue, taken advantage of a bullish bias and leverage from retail traders, to then push prices down,"" he said.The selloff also comes ahead of testimony by executives from eight major cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase Global CFO Alesia Haas and FTX Trading CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Dec. 8.The hearing marks the first time major players in the crypto markets will testify before U.S. lawmakers, as policymakers grapple with the implications of cryptocurrencies and how to best regulate them.Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected a second spot-bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposal from WisdomTree.Story continuesData from another platform Coinglass showed nearly $1 billion worth of cryptocurrencies had been liquidated over the past 24 hours, with the bulk being on digital exchange Bitfinex.""If anything, this is the opportunity to buy the dip for many investors who might have previously felt like they missed the boat. We can see tether bought at a premium, suggesting people are getting cash ready, within the crypto space, to do just that,"" D'Anethan said, referring to the biggest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency world.A plunge in bitcoin funding rates -- the cost of holding bitcoin via perpetual futures which peaked at 0.06% in October -- also showed traders had turned bearish.The funding rate on cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX fell to a negative 0.18% from levels of 0.01% for most of November.(Reporting by Maria Ponnezhath in Bengaluru and Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore.

At one point on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency was up more than 40% in value on the week, with the price per token having surged from below 0.000040 to nearly 0.000055. In terms of market capitalisation, the early week surge saw SHIB overall value rise to above $30B from under $22B.Shiba Inu was boosted at the time by the news that US-based crypto exchange Kraken would list the cryptocurrency, which is expected to deliver a further boost to its liquidity. The early week gains also coincided with a breakout above an important medium-term downtrend that had been capping the price action since late October.SHIB breaks above key downtrend. Source: FXEmpireGains prove short-livedMost of these early week gains have since been relinquished. SHIB/USD has reversed back to trade around 0.00004150 on Friday. That means its market cap has fallen back below $23B, though this still ranks its as the 13th most valuable cryptocurrency on aggregate.The 0.000040 area may offer some support, but if the buying momentum continues to fade, bears will be eyeing a test of recent lows in the 0.000035 region. This is a strong area of support as it also coincides with the pre-October 23rd pump highs.SHIB remains beholden to hypeAs usual, SHIB price action remains closely linked to indicators of social media/retail trader interest. The latest spike and retracement coincided with a sharp uptick in Lunarcrush’s Social Volume indicator, which rose from under 60K on Sunday to above 140K on Tuesday but has since dropped back to around 67K as of Friday.Recent spike in SHIB Social Volume. Source: LunarcrushWhales Betting More Gains to ComeThe early week surge in SHIB price saw SHIB whales piling in to add to their heavy long positions. By Tuesday, the average SHIB balance of the top 100 holders had risen by 40% to above 2.5B tokens, as per data from WhaleStates. That number has since risen to above 2.6B tokens as the whales continued to accumulate long positions over the course of the week, despite the pullback in prices.Story continuesPatience has paid dividends in the past for SHIB holders. After the spike in interest in the token back in May that sent SHIB market cap as high as $14B (a record high at the time), SHIB HODLers had to wait until October for the next spike in interest.No one knows when (or if) the next spike in price will come to take SHIB/USD beyond the late-October all-time highs at 0.00080. As in the past, the next spike will come as a result of a surge in social media/speculator interest in the memecoin.But, for now, it seems the whales remain confident that continued growth in the crypto space, as well Shiba Inu’s intention to move into the gaming industry, can power SHIB higher over the long term.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Daily Gold News: Friday, Dec. 3 – Gold Bounces Ahead of Jobs Data ReleaseOutlook for SHIB Positive as Confident Whales Build LongsMercadoLibre Launches new Crypto Services in BrazilU.S. Dollar Index (DX) Futures Technical Analysis – Close Over 96.500 Puts Index in Bullish PositionGrayscale Writes SEC, Says it is Breaking the lawEUR/USD Daily Forecast – Test Of Support At 1.1300","December 3, 2021, 9:56 AM"

The Sandbox also boasted the highest trading volume last week, taking in more than $86 million, while Decentraland followed in second place with more than $15 million traded for land plot NFTs.But what’s the increasing appeal of buying a plot of virtual land?Hayden Hughes, CEO of crypto social trading platform Alpha Impact, told GOBankingRates that NFTs and play-to-earn games – such as Axie Infinity from Vietnamese developers Sky Mavis – have brought an entire generation of people into shared online communities. Hughes expressed that, as these communities grow, participants have a creative desire to express themselves by owning items in the metaverse: in this case, owning land.“The rush to acquire land in the metaverse is driven by creatives who truly want to express themselves, and speculators who want to cash in. Unlike the ICO [initial coin offering] bubble in 2017, the metaverse has actual adoption and a thriving (albeit early) ecosystem. Facebook / Meta is not the leader in this space and the rebrand has also brought attention on the ecosystem,” Hughes said.DappRadar notes that it’s not only the appetite for metaverse experiences that’s increasing, but also the price for metaverse land. Last week, five of the 10 most expensive NFT sales concerned metaverse land plot NFTs in different virtual worlds.Discover: Enjoy Online Gaming? Turn Your Passion Into a Side Hustle With These 5 OptionsThe top grosser was the Fashion Street Estate in Decentraland, which switched owners for 618.000 MANA, or $2.42 million, per the data. However, last month, an Axie Genesis plot – the scarcest land in yet another stand-alone metaverse game – sold for 550 Ethereum (ETH). This transaction represented “the largest sale ever for a single plot of digital land,” according to a tweet from the developers, with 550 ETH being equivalent to $2.48 million as of Dec. 3.Story continuesAxie Infinity, Denctraland, and Metaverse GamingAccording to Axie Infinity documentation, “Lunacia, the Axie homeland, is divided into tokenized plots of land which act as homes and bases of operation for their Axies. Plots can be upgraded over time using a variety of resources and crafting ingredients that can be found when playing the game.”Lunacia consists of 90,601 plots of Land, which are represented as NFTs and can be freely traded by players, according to the developer documentation. The Genesis property in question is particularly valuable because of its scarcity: there are only 220 Genesis plots within the game’s 90,601 plots.A recent report from Grayscale Investments explains this evolution of the “creator economy,” known as “play-to-earn,” which allows users to own their digital assets as NFTs, trade them with others in the game, and sometimes carry them to other digital experiences. As such, projects like Decentraland are creating an open-world metaverse wherein users can log in to play games, earn MANA (the native token of Decentraland, with which users can purchase NFTs, including LAND or collectibles), vote on economy governance, or create NFTs. The presumed benefit of this framework is that it gives users substantial interoperability between systems as a value proposition for their time spent in-game.Matt Maximo, research analyst at Grayscale Investments and co-author of the report, told GOBankingRates that land in the metaverse is a really interesting concept because traditional real-estate is valued largely due to proximity to shops, services, and other people – you’re bound by the time it takes to travel from your home.Many metaverses like Decentraland, however, allow players to teleport around the world, making travel instantaneous and irrelevant to valuation. However, given that this market is extremely new, a lot of the higher priced sales have come from LAND parcels with good locations – ie. proximity to major attractions in the metaverse.“Investing in LAND is exciting but comes with the risks of any emerging market. LAND and MANA holders are incentivized to prevent expanding the Decentraland map and keeping the number of parcels low, however, there will also be a point where expanding the map and creating new LAND to sell will benefit them more than the dilution of their property,” he said.He added that because LAND plots are NFTs, liquidity is much lower with these assets than with the underlying tokens like MANA.“If you are in a time crunch to sell, you may be forced to sell below market value to the available bidder, whereas if I hold MANA, I can simply go to an exchange like Uniswap or Coinbase and instantly make the trade,” he added.Infinite Land in the Metaverse?While the expanding opportunities within the metaverse have dramatically incentivized the buying of land as a way for participants to stake their claim in a virtual world, one potential issue is that there might bealso be an infinite supply of land.“So it is very difficult to gauge the value that the land will hold in the future, and in that sense, buying right now could be seen as a risky investment. For example, if digital land becomes so abundant, then supply-demand economics kicks in and the price will go down. However, the sheer number of possibilities that the metaverse might be able to offer may outweigh the risk for investors who want to be sure that they’re among the first to own land in the digital space.” Reeve Collins – co-founder of BLOCKv & SmartMedia Technologies – told GOBankingRates.See: Crypto Regulation: Fed Announces Roadmap for 2022 — What It Means for Investors and DevelopersFind: Understanding the Metaverse and How it Relates to CryptocurrencyThe frenzied push to purchase digital real estate might create a brief crash, Eduardo Erlo, marketing manager at blockchain-based encrypted messenger Status, told GOBankingRates. Elro elaborated to suggest that because land in the metaverse may be so infinitely abundant, paying large amounts of money for it now could prove fruitless.One way to circumvent the infinite abundance of digital land, he said, would be for some metaverses to have built-in scarcity concerning plots of land — such as the Genesis virtual land mentioned earlier — akin to the kind of built-in monetary investment scarcity that Bitcoin offers. “It’s still too early to know any of this, but it’s exciting to watch,” he said.The market opportunity for bringing any number of metaverses to life may be worth more than $1 trillion in annual revenue, according to Grayscale. The asset management firm estimates that revenue from virtual gaming worlds could grow to $400 billion in 2025, from $180 billion in 2020.Several experts agree that purchases of virtual land in the metaverse can therefore be viewed as an investment of sorts. That is, as a bet that the metaverse — and the individual metaverses within the greater whole — will deliver on promises and transform into a dynamic virtual ecosystem in which we will all be, in some way, participating in, according to Robert Powers, director of decentralized media at Vivid Labs.Powers told GOBankingRates, however, that we are still in the early days of the emergent metaverse — or metaverses, because there will likely be many of them, not just one — and so we should be cautious about speculation that leads to the kind of rapid prices increases that we are seeing right now in terms of digital land.“But all in all, this explosion of development offers tremendous potential for what is to come in a more fully immersive digital world. Maybe these early buyers of digital land could be the equivalent of owning the digital Empire State Building or New York City itself,” he said.Dan Patterson, general partner at an NFT-focused investment firm Sfermion, makes another point in terms of the value of digital real estate.“Each plot of digital real estate, in these future environments, will be a 3-dimensional profile page that is entirely user-owned and generated,” he told GOBankingRates, adding, “How much is the most high-traffic page on Instagram worth?”More From GOBankingRatesSocial Security 2022: How the COLA Will Increase Benefits for the Average Senior Couple21 Items That Are Always Cheaper at CostcoThis Free Tool Automatically Checks for the Best Deal on AmazonHow To Refinance a MortgageThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Metaverse Virtual Real Estate is Booming: What’s the Appeal?","December 3, 2021, 10:03 PM"

Your weekly horoscope for December 5 has your back!With a very active Mars and Pluto asserting themselves at this time. Mars is the lower vibration of Pluto—both powerful and fiery planets, eager to conquest and live vividly.On December 6, fiery Mars in Scorpio will sextile Pluto in Capricorn. As with all Martian planetary aspects, we will feel this energy both in the days leading up to and after its exact link. This will give us a tremendous amount of passion to tackle our goals and assert ourselves in the pursuit of our ambitions. A great deal of progress can be had if we are to funnel this endurance into a focused course of action. Also, this will enhance our sexual magnetism, giving us an air of irresistible authority.December 7 will bring Mercury in Sagittarius into a square with Neptune in Pisces. This has a weakening effect upon our minds, as we are cast beneath a fog. Deception is quite possible now—to ourselves or to others. It is best to table discussions to another day, as we are not thinking clearly.December 8 will cause Mars in Scorpio to square Jupiter in Aquarius. This larger-than-life energy is somewhat like a double-edged sword, as we can certainly achieve major success and fortune by asserting ourselves through action. However, this energy can also manifest in the form of accidents, injuries, and falls from grace if we are too impulsive and cocky. Practice moderation and burn off some of the extra energy with a hard fitness routine.Sign up for our newsletters and get in-depth astrological content delivered in your inbox!Venus & Pluto: Intense ConnectionsNext, on December 11, Venus will conjunct Pluto in Capricorn. This will increase our need for companionship, love, and union to an extremely deep level. We will have an ability to attract others to us by dominating situations and showing people that we know what we want and who we are. However, power plays can occur if we are acting selfishly. Healthy relationships can grow profoundly, but toxic ones can become even more abusive. Try to balance this oily energy without becoming consumed by it.Story continuesAlso on December 11, Mercury in Sagittarius will sextile Jupiter in Aquarius. Happy news, optimism, and excellent decision-making will occur. As both planets hold ties to business and travel, these areas will shine quite well, too. Sign agreements or plan a future vacation.

221,https://yahoo.com/news/money-speed-thought-fast-money-003550039.html,Money at the Speed of Thought: How ‘Fast Money’ Will Shape the Future,"Around 2008, an ambitious startup decided to dig a tunnel from Chicago to New York. It would be an arduous and expensive task, with a final price tag of $300 million. But the tunnel would move spectacularly valuable payloads at unprecedented speeds, and customers would pay handsomely for the privilege.The tunnel was not, however, for a new highway, or a high-speed rail line, or a gas pipe. It would not move goods or people or raw materials. In fact, a tall person would have a hard time standing up in it.Instead, the tunnel was intended to move just one thing: money.Completed in 2010, Spread Networks’ new tunnel was home to a fiber-optic cable that sent trading orders from Chicago to New York a whole 3 milliseconds ahead of the next-fastest pathway. Marginal as it might seem, those 3 milliseconds would give the new cable’s users a crucial edge against their competition. The customers were then-trendy “high-frequency trading” investment firms, whose algorithmic strategies often reacted to the same set of signals. A 3 millisecond advantage meant getting better price tags on trading positions, again and again and again. At least in theory, it was a license to print money.Ten years later, we’re entering a different era of monetary speed. By leveraging the internet and innovative blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies can move money around the world faster than legacy banking and payments systems, while also giving control directly to users instead of middlemen. That will have a huge number of implications for commerce, for globalization – and most of all, for investment.What We Talk About When We Talk About SpeedYou may have noticed a slight inaccuracy above: Spread Networks’ fiber-optic cable wasn’t really “moving money” between Chicago and New York. Instead, it was transmitting orders, and the traders using it presumably had trusted relationships, credit lines or other means to guarantee that they had the money to back those orders up.Story continuesThis two-tier system is how the vast majority of money transmission works now. Think about the act of handing someone a paper check (for those outside of the retrograde U.S.A., let me Google that for you. Are you handing them “money”? Not at all. You’re handing them a promise to deliver money from your bank account. When they deposit it, their bank and your bank trade a fairly complex series of messages to confirm the money is available.The money doesn’t actually move from one bank’s ledger to the other’s until that back-and-forth resolves to everyone’s satisfaction. That can be a good while after the check is deposited, much less after you gave it to your friend. An international transfer involves a still higher level of negotiation and confirmation before a transaction is well and truly “settled.”The first wave of “fast money” services, whether PayPal or Mastercard or Venmo, hasn’t really upended that model. Instead, the services largely move money “faster” by either creating a self-contained walled garden that adjusts only an internal ledger or accepting a certain amount of the risk to paper over the delay between transmission and settlement. (I suspect this is why you can pay an added fee to send money “faster” with PayPal, for instance. You’re not actually paying for faster processing – you’re paying an insurance premium on increased settlement risk.)So when we talk about cryptocurrencies being “faster,” we’re not quite talking about the kind of speed that Spread Networks was chasing with its fiber-optic cable. Bitcoin can’t somehow magically send data faster than Mastercard can. Instead, the “speed” of crypto is at the settlement stage: Instead of a complicated tete-a-tete between banks that may or may not actually trust each other, Bitcoin and other cryptos combine transmission and settlement.That is why cryptocurrency is referred to as “digital cash.” When you send it, it moves directly into the possession and control of the recipient – there is no distinction between transmission and settlement. On Bitcoin, this takes 10 minutes and costs less than $3.Despite the back-end differences, the speed of cryptocurrency offers some of the same agility that high-frequency traders sought from Spread Networks. As our Michael Casey has discussed, the interoperability of different crypto systems is also becoming faster, amounting to a universally interoperable fast payments system. That’s possible because, unlike PayPal, crypto networks are open access – anyone can plug a service into them, build their own front-end, whatever.It’s hard to envision exactly how this is going to have a huge impact on retail payments. PayPal and the like work perfectly fast enough for ordering Christmas gifts, though crypto’s borderlessness opens up some meaningful new possibilities around the edges. One possible exception is the credit card business model, which basically depends on soaking the poorest users in exchange for convenience. If consumer-friendly crypto services deliver similar convenience without the debt bondage, there could be a shakeup.The implications for cross-border remittances are more obvious, but not terribly interesting. Using the old rails, a service like Western Union charges craaaaaaazy fees to deliver money to a select number of countries. On the fundamentals of lower fees and better service, crypto wins that battle, though there are still big shortfalls in awareness, complexity and user experience. Give it a few more years, though, and there’s no reason for Western Union’s remittance service to continue to exist.Welcome to Thunderdome: The Scary Future of Fast InvestmentThe distinction between a credit card or PayPal payment and a crypto payment, then, isn’t that big if you’re talking about shopping. In remittances, the crypto advantage is pretty much a straightforward upgrade without too many weird nuances.But there is one realm where the change is going to be deep and strange and have a lot of unexpected consequences. The one thing you can do with crypto that you can’t do with a Mastercard or PayPal or Western Union is send and settle a sizable investment halfway around the world to a stranger in 10 minutes. The end-to-end speed of cryptocurrency opens up an entirely new rhythm to collective financial projects, and it is going to be truly wild.We’ve seen dramatic illustrations of this new breed of “fast investment” in recent months. Constitution DAO, for instance, raised $40 million in about a week to buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution. That’s not exactly a traditional investment, but consider that as recently as a few years ago, the announcement of a new $40 million venture capital fund was enough to generate mainstream headlines. Sometimes it still is!Under a traditional model, that $40 million is hard-won, involving a lot of sweaty meetings and elaborate PowerPoint presentations. But here comes a gang of newly rich goofballs and they do it with some Nicholas Cage memes and duct tape without leaving their basements. The same is happening for more traditionally oriented crypto venture capital efforts, whether decentralized or more traditional.Both in traditional and crypto VC, it’s a common talking point that speed in investing that money matters more than ever. If you want the returns from a hot startup or founder, you have to get in the room first and shove a wad of money down their pants. This will become even more pronounced as the money-raising process gets faster, and it will apply doubly to VC projects set up as decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs..This is where we start to get to the real downsides, though. The increased speed of both raising and allocating capital seems poised to put pressure on the kind of careful decision-making that has long characterized investing of all sorts. The postwar Western financial system has arguably been defined by the rise of the analyst, a kind of mathematical trench warrior of capitalism. The job of the analyst is to examine boring things like inventories and profit margins and what a company is actually doing, or the potential market for a proposed startup.The analyst lives in some windowless back office of a bank or a hedge fund. Closer to the light sit the rainmakers who bring new money into a bank or fund, and the brokers who buy and sell assets. Both the gathering and deployment of capital under these models are slow, thoughtful processes, if nothing else because of structural and technological constraints. The analyst, you might argue, is an artifact of slow money.As money gets faster, and especially in the kind of loose monetary environment we’re in now, the analyst is increasingly left in the dust. In his place, decisions both by investors and allocators (VCs) will increasingly be based on what you might call “money vibes.” The power of memes and social media discourse in driving investment on Robinhood or in crypto has been widely observed, but they’ve been largely treated as oddities or punchlines, even in the financial press. The truth is, they’re just getting started, and they’re going to define the way things work in the high-speed future of crypto-enabled capital agglomeration.For a small elite of the most knowledgeable investors and allocators, that is going to be great. Fast judgment doesn’t inherently mean bad judgment, and more than a few investments that have been carefully vetted by the analyst manage to go belly up before the ink is dry.“If you really know what’s going on, you don’t even have to know what’s going on to know what’s going on,” as the pseudonymous Adam Smith put it in investing classic “The Money Game.” “All you need is a hell of an apperceptive mass [and] an IQ of 150 … and you can ignore the headlines, because you anticipated them months ago.”That won’t change as money accelerates. The big winners will still be the same types: plugged-in, intuitive, confident and good judges of character.But in an accelerated investment environment, the losers might look a lot different. What if the National Treasure memes that helped make Constitution DAO happen were instead memes about how “We’re going to start a Metaverse Venture Capital DAO!” One seductive meme about a sector (or just catchphrase) that’s super hot RIGHT NOW would attract a lot of small amateur investors, especially if it took just a few mouse clicks. These folks don’t necessarily know the difference between the best allocator in the business and the 20th best. They don’t know all that much about the nuances of markets. They don’t have the emotional self-control that makes a great investor.So more often than not, in a fast money environment, they will get rekt. Investment becomes a rapid-fire series of hype and collapse, and the losers get to lose that much faster.We’ve recently seen a kind of low-tech preview of this, by the way, courtesy of something called a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. SPACs use the stock market as something like a faster VC fundraising pipeline, albeit with a focus on acquisitions rather than on early funding. SPACs focused on trendy sectors like electric cars, but they’ve wound up as mostly iffy investments that benefitted charismatic organizers like Chamath Palihapitiyah and Bill Ackman more than their actual participants.One possible consequence of this higher-speed environment would be, ironically, a greater role for personal reputation and connections. The best investment vehicles will continue to be based on personal connections and the intuitions of those truly in the know, while promoted tweets raise meme money from the suckers.At least in principle, that is why the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission limits hedge fund and VC investing to so-called “accredited investors.” But both technological innovation and a rising chorus of criticism suggests that the dam can’t hold for much longer. (Notably, the biggest critics of accredited investor rules tend to run VC or hedge funds. Go figure.)The same issue is even more dire for nations like China that want to keep residents’ capital within their borders, even if that’s not where the best investments are. Far more than any concern about the energy use of proof-of-work mining or the risks of speculation and scams, it’s easy to see China’s crypto crackdown this year as an attempt to pre-empt an environment where capital flight is just a few clicks away. We’re sure to see similar moves, or even more draconian measures, as other lackluster economies realize what they’re up against.And fair enough: Capital flight is a real threat to even well-run developing economies. But crypto investing could wind up being a double-edged sword in those cases, because compelling investments in obscure corners of the world could also potentially attract capital more easily. That rhymes with the path to economic globalization and integration over the last 30 years, which has created more wealth and big winners in the developing world, but also more volatility and risk for those at the bottom of the economic ladder.Speed turned out to be a mixed bag for the high-frequency traders, too. They’re still important players and make up a large percentage of asset trades by volume, but returns from the strategy have declined over the past decade. Privately held Spread Networks, the builder of that Chicago to New York fiber-optic tunnel, doesn’t seem to have profited from speed, either: The link was slated to be sold in 2017 for $125 million, a serious haircut against the money spent on it.","December 4, 2021, 1:35 AM"

Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break back through to $57,000 levels.Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Friday’s high $57,599 would likely cap the upside.In the event of an extended rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $60,000 levels before easing back. The second major resistance level sits at $60,472. Bitcoin would need plenty of support, however, to breakout from $58,500 levels.Failure to move through the $54,206 pivot would bring the 23.6% FIB of $53,628 and the first major support level at $50,814 into play. Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$49,000 levels.

The bank’s private wealth division took a peek at NFTs in a report back in April.The JPMorgan NFTs were minted on Ethereum layer 2 network Polygon.JPMorgan is not the first bank to issue a commemorative NFT; Bank of America created one about a month ago.","December 3, 2021, 10:21 PM"

The Polygon token has a fully diluted market capitalization of over 17 billion USD as of November 15, 2021.The carbon output of Polygon is so low that Bubblehouse x Polygon neutralized the entire blockchain’s carbon with less than 10K USD in carbon offsets via the non-profit organization One Tree Planted’s carbon offset program. Bubblehouse x Polygon have published the calculations publicly for all to view, in addition to the carbon offset certification.This program establishes Bubblehouse as the first carbon-neutral NFT marketplace, and Polygon the first carbon-neutral blockchain network.With a commitment to sustainability, Bubblehouse opens the door to all creators and collectors who so far have avoided NFTs due to Ethereum’s carbon impact. To put Polygon’s sustainability into context, creating an NFT on Polygon is equivalent to sending less than 2.5 emails, while creating an NFT on Ethereum is equivalent to sending 20,750 emails.The table below showcases Polygon’s sustainability relative to other human activities and Ethereum.ActionKgCO2 emissionEthereum NFT creation83.000Paperback book1.0000Weekend newspaper0.3000Per user FB yearly usage0.3000Email with photo0.0500One hour video streaming - all platforms average0.0360Polygon NFT creation0.0098Regular email0.0040Spam email0.0003Google Search0.0002Bubblehouse x Polygon paves the way to the next frontier of eco-consciousness within the NFT space, in the hopes that others will follow.Story continues“Sustainability is a core value for Bubblehouse and our community.

It proved that fully decentralized digital money could be used reliably and without being censored. The marketplace became something of a media curiosity – drugs were being sold quite openly – and was shut down by the feds.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Ulbricht is now serving two consecutive life sentences, plus 40 years, without the option of parole. He’s risen to a near-mythic status within the crypto community for putting his life on the line to make the libertarian case that individuals should be able to decide who to interact with and what to buy – a similar aim of the Bitcoin network.Now, his latest auction might demonstrate the same utility for NFTs. At heart, NFTs are a way to prove the uniqueness of particular digital items. They are mostly used for in-game items and art, but have applicability across the internet. Like with bitcoin, the idea is that anyone can use, own or trade these assets.See also: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving | The NodeA jaw-dropping amount of wealth has been generated in NFT markets, which is quickly forming its own identity apart from the general cryptocurrency economy. They have permeated into mainstream culture – with celebrities and corporations alike hawking their projects – as both a tool for freedom and something of a joke.Charitable efforts, too, have caught on. On the 20th anniversary of 9/11, the New Yorker magazine issued an NFT series with proceeds going to victims. Given the harrowing cause, I look at that auction as a sea change; NFTs are serious, and they are likely here to stay. New York’s toniest magazine wouldn’t besmirch the legacy of survivors with a fad.Story continuesUlbricht’s series has similar potential by showing that this is a powerful tool even for causes you may personally object to. That’s important. For whatever else crypto may be now or may become, it’s vital to have a digital form of money you can use like cash. (Visa and Mastercard have made online shopping a breeze, but they are the ultimate gatekeepers of what you can buy.)Auction of the Ross Ulbricht Genesis Collection, which compiles original artwork, political statements, poetry and animations produced by digital artist Levitate into a single token, began yesterday at an Art Basel event in Miami and will run until Dec. 8. The token lives on the Ethereum network, and the art can be viewed and purchased on the curated NFT marketplace SuperRare.Ulbricht is no doubt a complicated and controversial figure. He was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. There’s a strong case that the criminal justice system has failed him – laying out an unconscionable sentence in a misguided attempt to make an example out of him – and thousands of other people. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the average sentence for a drug trafficker is 77 months. He’s not a hero, but he deserves justice.At this point, his mother Lynn Ulbricht, and his defense organization have basically run out of legal options. In his own words, “Decades of incarceration stretch out in front of me.” He found God, found purpose and is now an advocate for the countless others done wrong by the U.S. penal system.See also: No Visits, No Parole: Ross Ulbricht Is More Alone Than Ever During COVID-19“As I face that future, my eventual old age and death in this cage, I find myself looking for meaning and purpose. Why am I here? What good can I do with the time I have left and from where I am? I hope that helping my fellow prisoners through my art is one way,” he wrote in a Medium post announcing the NFT launch.The series has already drawn a tremendous amount of attention and support, though some uppity bitcoin-only crypto investors – once his most vocal and generous supporters – have criticized the project. It doesn’t matter what they think. Their worldview is already irrelevant, if they cannot see how closely most of crypto advances their cause toward credibly neutral platforms.Current bidding stands above 250 ETH, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, worth about $1.1 million. That money may not free Ross, but it could go to good use. Money should be free, and (most) people, too.","December 3, 2021, 6:48 PM"

Bitcoin was trading at the lower end of its weeklong trading range around $53,000 at the time of publication, which is below its $1 trillion market capitalization.BTC, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is up about 2% over the past week compared to a 7% gain in ether and a 13% gain in Solana’s SOL token over the same period. The dispersion in weekly returns suggests that alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) are starting to outperform.Latest pricesBitcoin (BTC): $53,528, -6.2%Ether (ETH): $4,218, -7.2%S&P 500: -0.9%Gold: $1,783, +0.8%10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.36%Headwinds for risk assetsSome analysts are paying close attention to the slower pace of global monetary easing, which could reduce investors’ appetite for speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies and equities.“In our view, the speed with which global liquidity contracts is the most important factor for cryptocurrency performance in the weeks ahead and possibly even into early 2022,” Coinbase wrote in a newsletter to institutional clients on Friday. The U.S. crypto exchange noted that overall market performance could be mixed heading into the U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14-15.“The steady unwinding of monetary accommodation in 2022 points to both lower returns for equities and losses for bonds, and greater volatility than over the past 20 months,” MRB Partners, a global investment research firm, wrote in a Friday report.Ether takes a breatherEther, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to struggle below its all-time price high of $4,865. The current pullback in ETH could stabilize around the $4,000 support level, although the price rally since the July low around $1,740 is starting to fade.On a relative basis, ether is poised to outperform bitcoin if a breakout above 0.08 in the ETH/BTC ratio is confirmed next week. Charts still show significant resistance, which preceded downturns in ETH/BTC during the 2018 crypto bear market.Story continues“This [pending] breakout is essential because it represents a resistance line going back to the 2017 top when one ETH was 0.15 BTC.

228,https://yahoo.com/news/most-popular-cryptocurrency-canada-103009830.html,What is the most popular cryptocurrency in Canada?,"Bitcoin seems to be the most prominent cryptocurrency on the public’s lips, and rightly so. It remains the most significant cryptocurrency on the market.That market, though, has been flooded with literally thousands of different digital currencies. There is a name for these coins; they are called ‘altcoins‘ – alternatives to Bitcoin.Since its debut in 2009, Bitcoin has remained the largest and most popular cryptocurrency in Canada and remains a public favourite. Even though Bitcoin remains the biggest in the market, more cryptocurrencies are starting to catch up and become well-used. Here are some of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the Canadian market.Most Popular cryptocurrencies in Canada 1. Bitcoin (BTC)Bitcoin started the cryptocurrency era and remains the most widely used coin. It is generally impossible for people around the world to speak about cryptocurrency without talking about Bitcoin. Price: $54,515Market cap: $1.3 trillion2. Ethereum (ETH)Ethereum is the second-most popular cryptocurrency platform you may have heard in the Canadian crypto space. It is a diverse system that allows users to perform different functions, but its popularity is attributed to its smart contracts feature.Price: $4,085Market cap: $574 billion3. Binance Coin (BNB)Binance Coin is the official cryptocurrency of Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges in Canada. However, it was created to serve as a token to aid with payments for discounted trades. Binance Coin is now used for day-to-day transactions just like any other cryptocurrency.Price: $594.69Market cap: $109 billion4. Solana (SOL)Solana is a new cryptocurrency that was launched in March 2020. It prides itself on the speeds at which transactions are done on the platform and its overall robustness.Price: $245.71Market cap: $74 billionNB: The above prices were taken on 27/11/2021Most popular crypto exchanges in CanadaChoosing the right cryptocurrency exchange could differ between making it in the crypto space or completely flopping and failing. The cryptocurrency exchange you choose could affect how profitable your day-to-day trades are, how speedily you can buy and sell assets, and, unfortunately, if you will ever get your money or any profit in the first place.Story continuesThis might come as a surprise, but they are many cryptocurrency exchange scams running, even in Canada. In 2019, thousands of everyday Canadians lost millions of dollars in the QuadrigaCX scandal and, to date, these people still haven’t seen their money.Therefore, it is essential to choose a secure Canadian cryptocurrency exchange that is user-friendly and will keep your money safe. Here are three of the most popular exchanges in Canada:1. CoinSmartCoinSmart takes the gold for the best cryptocurrency exchange in Canada. If it is a new name to you, that’s because it has been focusing on improving trading services and not on marketing. But if you meet any veteran Canadian crypto trader, they are sure to tell you that this cryptocurrency exchange lives up to its name and is widely viewed as the best in the game.2. Crypto.comCrypto.com is a world power in the cryptocurrency exchange business and has recently made its mark on the Canadian crypto market. Reports state that it supports more than 100 cryptocurrencies, making it perfect for any user to invest in altcoins.This cryptocurrency exchange offers some features that are unique only to it. It allows users to trade and create contracts and also earn interest by staking coins. Users can also make trades with 10x leverage if they are confident in a coin.3. BitbuyCoinSmart might be the best cryptocurrency exchange app in Canada, and Crypto.com makes a strong case for second place, but Bitbuy takes home the bronze. It offers nine cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ripple, Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Aave, Ethereum, and Chainlink. This cryptocurrency exchange boasts about its customer service and has a functional app with an outstanding interface that is well-rated by users. Buyers can fund their account directly from their bank account by making an INTERAC e-transfer or via bank wire, and your deposits will be made quickly.In conclusion, Bitcoin has remained the most popular cryptocurrency globally since its inception in 2009, and it has continued to grow. Canada has not been left out of this growth and continues to take advantage of this. Although Bitcoin might be the most prominent cryptocurrency in Canada, there are others following closely on that list. ","December 4, 2021, 11:30 AM"
229,https://yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-extends-downtrend-falls-12-055642132.html,"Bitcoin falls by a fifth, cryptos see $1 billion worth liquidated","By Maria Ponnezhath and Vidya Ranganathan(Reuters) -Bitcoin shed a fifth of its value on Saturday as a combination of profit-taking and macro-economic concerns triggered nearly a billion dollars worth of selling across cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin was 12% down at 0920 GMT at $47,495. It fell as low as $41,967.5 during the session, taking total losses for the day to 22%.The broad selloff in cryptocurrencies also saw ether, the coin linked to the ethereum blockchain network, plunge more than 10%.Based on cryptocurrency data platform Coingecko, the market capitalisation of the 11,392 coins it tracks dropped nearly 15% to $2.34 trillion. That value had briefly crossed $3 trillion last month, when bitcoin hit a record $69,000.The plunge follows a volatile week for financial markets. Global equities and benchmark U.S. bond yields tumbled on Friday after data showed U.S. job growth slowed in November and the Omicron variant of the coronavirus kept investors on edge.Justin d'Anethan, Hong Kong-based head of exchange sales at cryptocurrency exchange EQONEX, said he had been watching the increase in leverage ratios across the cryptocurrency markets as well how large holders had been moving their coins from wallets to exchanges. The latter is usually a sign of intent to sell.""Whales in the crypto space seem to have transferred coins to trading venue, taken advantage of a bullish bias and leverage from retail traders, to then push prices down,"" he said.The selloff also comes ahead of testimony by executives from eight major cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase Global CFO Alesia Haas and FTX Trading CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Dec. 8.The hearing marks the first time major players in the crypto markets will testify before U.S. lawmakers, as policymakers grapple with the implications of cryptocurrencies and how to best regulate them.Last week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejected a second spot-bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposal from WisdomTree.Story continuesData from another platform Coinglass showed nearly $1 billion worth of cryptocurrencies had been liquidated over the past 24 hours, with the bulk being on digital exchange Bitfinex.""If anything, this is the opportunity to buy the dip for many investors who might have previously felt like they missed the boat. We can see tether bought at a premium, suggesting people are getting cash ready, within the crypto space, to do just that,"" D'Anethan said, referring to the biggest stablecoin in the cryptocurrency world.A plunge in bitcoin funding rates -- the cost of holding bitcoin via perpetual futures which peaked at 0.06% in October -- also showed traders had turned bearish.The funding rate on cryptocurrency trading platform BitMEX fell to a negative 0.18% from levels of 0.01% for most of November.(Reporting by Maria Ponnezhath in Bengaluru and Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore.

New York’s toniest magazine wouldn’t besmirch the legacy of survivors with a fad.Story continuesUlbricht’s series has similar potential by showing that this is a powerful tool even for causes you may personally object to. That’s important. For whatever else crypto may be now or may become, it’s vital to have a digital form of money you can use like cash. (Visa and Mastercard have made online shopping a breeze, but they are the ultimate gatekeepers of what you can buy.)Auction of the Ross Ulbricht Genesis Collection, which compiles original artwork, political statements, poetry and animations produced by digital artist Levitate into a single token, began yesterday at an Art Basel event in Miami and will run until Dec. 8. The token lives on the Ethereum network, and the art can be viewed and purchased on the curated NFT marketplace SuperRare.Ulbricht is no doubt a complicated and controversial figure. He was convicted of money laundering, computer hacking and conspiracy to traffic narcotics. There’s a strong case that the criminal justice system has failed him – laying out an unconscionable sentence in a misguided attempt to make an example out of him – and thousands of other people. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the average sentence for a drug trafficker is 77 months. He’s not a hero, but he deserves justice.At this point, his mother Lynn Ulbricht, and his defense organization have basically run out of legal options. In his own words, “Decades of incarceration stretch out in front of me.” He found God, found purpose and is now an advocate for the countless others done wrong by the U.S. penal system.See also: No Visits, No Parole: Ross Ulbricht Is More Alone Than Ever During COVID-19“As I face that future, my eventual old age and death in this cage, I find myself looking for meaning and purpose. Why am I here? What good can I do with the time I have left and from where I am? I hope that helping my fellow prisoners through my art is one way,” he wrote in a Medium post announcing the NFT launch.The series has already drawn a tremendous amount of attention and support, though some uppity bitcoin-only crypto investors – once his most vocal and generous supporters – have criticized the project. It doesn’t matter what they think. Their worldview is already irrelevant, if they cannot see how closely most of crypto advances their cause toward credibly neutral platforms.Current bidding stands above 250 ETH, the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain, worth about $1.1 million. That money may not free Ross, but it could go to good use. Money should be free, and (most) people, too.","December 3, 2021, 9:48 AM"

Bitcoin rose just 97%.Metaverse-related cryptocurrencies have surged an eye-popping 37,000% this year — far exceeding the gains of bitcoin, data from Macro Hive shows.The data was based on the gains of five coins: Axie Infinity, Decentraland, Sandbox, Enjin Coin, and GALA, which rallied 20% over the past seven days alone, the data showed.The coins are part of the metaverse, a term for the next phase of the internet where people can live, work, and play in the digital world. Small versions of the metaverse have already begun popping up. Axie Infinity, for example, allows users to play games to earn crypto. And in Decentraland, players can own digital land and other assets.The metaverse rally was likely ""turbocharged"" by Facebook's decision to rebrand to Meta Platforms as a sign of its push into the future internet, according to Macro Hive, a UK-based research firm. The data was first reported on by Bloomberg.Macro Hive put cryptocurrencies in four emerging categories: bitcoin, smart contract platforms, metaverse, and decentralized finance (DeFi).While metaverse coins were the ""clear outperformer,"" those related to smart contracts, which include applications based on ethereum, solana, cardano, avalanche, and polkadot, came in second with a whopping 2,355% rally in 2021.In third was DeFi, which counts services like Uniswap and PancakeSwap built on top of blockchain networks.

At one point on Tuesday, the cryptocurrency was up more than 40% in value on the week, with the price per token having surged from below 0.000040 to nearly 0.000055. In terms of market capitalisation, the early week surge saw SHIB overall value rise to above $30B from under $22B.Shiba Inu was boosted at the time by the news that US-based crypto exchange Kraken would list the cryptocurrency, which is expected to deliver a further boost to its liquidity. The early week gains also coincided with a breakout above an important medium-term downtrend that had been capping the price action since late October.SHIB breaks above key downtrend. Source: FXEmpireGains prove short-livedMost of these early week gains have since been relinquished. SHIB/USD has reversed back to trade around 0.00004150 on Friday. That means its market cap has fallen back below $23B, though this still ranks its as the 13th most valuable cryptocurrency on aggregate.The 0.000040 area may offer some support, but if the buying momentum continues to fade, bears will be eyeing a test of recent lows in the 0.000035 region. This is a strong area of support as it also coincides with the pre-October 23rd pump highs.SHIB remains beholden to hypeAs usual, SHIB price action remains closely linked to indicators of social media/retail trader interest. The latest spike and retracement coincided with a sharp uptick in Lunarcrush’s Social Volume indicator, which rose from under 60K on Sunday to above 140K on Tuesday but has since dropped back to around 67K as of Friday.Recent spike in SHIB Social Volume. Source: LunarcrushWhales Betting More Gains to ComeThe early week surge in SHIB price saw SHIB whales piling in to add to their heavy long positions. By Tuesday, the average SHIB balance of the top 100 holders had risen by 40% to above 2.5B tokens, as per data from WhaleStates. That number has since risen to above 2.6B tokens as the whales continued to accumulate long positions over the course of the week, despite the pullback in prices.Story continuesPatience has paid dividends in the past for SHIB holders. After the spike in interest in the token back in May that sent SHIB market cap as high as $14B (a record high at the time), SHIB HODLers had to wait until October for the next spike in interest.No one knows when (or if) the next spike in price will come to take SHIB/USD beyond the late-October all-time highs at 0.00080. As in the past, the next spike will come as a result of a surge in social media/speculator interest in the memecoin.But, for now, it seems the whales remain confident that continued growth in the crypto space, as well Shiba Inu’s intention to move into the gaming industry, can power SHIB higher over the long term.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Daily Gold News: Friday, Dec. 3 – Gold Bounces Ahead of Jobs Data ReleaseOutlook for SHIB Positive as Confident Whales Build LongsMercadoLibre Launches new Crypto Services in BrazilU.S. Dollar Index (DX) Futures Technical Analysis – Close Over 96.500 Puts Index in Bullish PositionGrayscale Writes SEC, Says it is Breaking the lawEUR/USD Daily Forecast – Test Of Support At 1.1300","December 3, 2021, 12:56 AM"

The penalties could reach as high as 20 crore rupees, equivalent to about $2.6 million dollars.As lawmakers hammer out India's regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, its central bank is planning to test a ""digital rupee"" in the next few months.

Some countries are considering legalising crypto following in the footsteps of El Salvador which now accepts Bitcoin as legal tender.The meteoric rise of Bitcoin has made it increasingly tougher for governments and the biggest players in finance and business to dismiss the highly volatile cryptocurrency. Billionaires including Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey among others have been showing great interest and faith in the possibility that cryptocurrency may be the currency of the future and pave the way forward in the fintech space.Irrespective of whether it should be considered a fiat currency or a risky, unregulated asset given that there are more than 10,000 cryptocurrencies in the world, the fact remains that people have been actively searching information related to them. Here are Yahoo Singapore readers’ top ten most-searched cryptocurrencies in 2021.1.

Its native luna token is then used to stabilize the price of the protocol's algorithmically-backed TerraUSD stablecoin, UST. According to its whitepaper, luna holders can submit and vote on governance proposals of their own.This week, investors voted to allow community funding for an overhaul of the network's ""TrackTerra"" tax and reporting app. That will allow luna holders to export transactions to different tax software programs, according to a tweet from developer Terra.The US government is tightening the rules around tax liabilities stemming from cryptocurrency transactions. This was one of the catalysts that knocked bitcoin, ether and other major coins lower in November, when Joe Biden's infrastructure bill — which includes regulations for crypto — passed into law.Luna has been one of the strongest-performing major cryptocurrencies over the last seven days, much to the enthusiasm of its ""LUNAtic"" community of supporters. The price was up 7.2% at $67.83 in the 24 hours to 06:45 a.m. ET on Friday, bringing its market capitalization above $26 billion. Earlier in the day, it hit a record $70.46 on the Binance exchange.Story continuesIts network rolled out a major upgrade last month, aimed at better maintaining the peg of the TerraUSD to its fiat value. In turn, that resulted in over 93 million luna tokens being ""burned,"" effectively vanishing from circulation, according to FX Leaders analyst Aiswarya Gopan.Part of luna's popularity is coming from the rapid evolution of decentralized finance. Along with competitors such as avalanche and solana, terra has been gobbling up market share from leading DeFi blockchain ethereum, thanks to its faster transaction speed and lower ""gas"" fees.JPMorgan currency strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou flagged Terra's advantages relative to some rival protocols in a recent research note.""Terra is a stablecoin-issuing platform using a mechanism that minimizes volatility to achieve close peg of the issued stablecoins to fiat currencies,"" he said.""This mechanism, operating via dynamic expansion and contraction of token supply, issues several regional stablecoins that can be swapped, making the Terra platform particularly suitable for cross border payments,"" he added.Read the original article on Business Insider","December 3, 2021, 3:59 AM"

Clearly, the NFT market is trending up, and more people are looking to buy into or utilize this unique new form of digital transactions.

Each token represents a unique digital profile recorded on the blockchain digital ledger. This means that two NFTs are completely unique.In a recent article, we analysed the main two areas currently in the spotlight for their NFT use cases, collectibles and gaming, and explored how investors can find promising NFT projects.How did NFTs create a $10 billion market?Their scarcity.They allow convenient transactions in the metaverse.They give artists and content creators more control over their work.What do I get when I buy NFT?There are three parties involved in minting and trading NFT rights:The creator of the original workThe creator of the NFTThe NFT buyer. In the case of a painting, for example, the original creator creates a painting, the NFT creator casts it as an NFT on OpenSea and puts it up for sale, and the NFT buyer buys it.When the creator of the original work and the creator of the NFT work are the same personThe attribution of rights will be agreed in appropriate terms and set out in a smart contract on the platform to declare what rights the buyer of the NFT work can expect from the creator.Often, the agreed rights are only those attached to the cast NFT work, not those attached to the original work. For example, Christie’s contracts indicate that the buyer of an NFT acquires only ownership of the NFT and rights to store, sell and dispose of it. However, they do not necessarily own the intellectual property rights of the original work on which the NFT is based.Story continuesTherefore, a buyer who purchases an NFT does not acquire any rights to the original work on which the NFT is minted, unless the contract specifically agrees otherwise.When the creator of the original work is not the same person as the creator of the NFT workThe NFT artist uploads the original work to the blockchain and mints the NFT to be traded, thus gaining profit.

248,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-confined-familiar-range-stocks-102539189.html,Bitcoin Confined to Familiar Range as Stocks Rise Ahead of Payrolls Data,"Bitcoin continues to trade in a familiar range as traditional markets exhibit improved risk appetite, with investors eyeing the release of the U.S. monthly employment report.The top cryptocurrency was trading near $57,000 at press time, extending a three-day-long consolidation in the range of $55,800 to $59,300.European stocks traded higher, tracking an overnight bounce on Wall Street, which saw the S&P 500 index surge 1.4%. However, gains were moderate, at best, with COVID concerns dominating the sentiment. Australia reported the first case of the Omicron variant early Friday despite having travel restrictions in place. The U.S. also registered the first case early this week.The U.S. nonfarm payrolls data scheduled for release at 13:30 UTC on Friday is forecast to show the world’s largest economy added 550,000 jobs in November after 531,000 additions in October. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 4.5% from 4.6%, while the average hourly earnings is forecast to increase 0.4% month-on-month, according to FXStreet.The dollar could resume its recent uptrend, putting downward pressure on bitcoin and asset prices, in general, if the payrolls data bolsters bets of faster normalization of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed).“Another 500,000+ increase in the headline number, a decline in the unemployment rate and an increase in hourly earnings should all keep short-dated U.S. rates supported on the view that the Fed could exit super-loose policy more quickly,” ING analysts noted in a blog post.“Any sharper-than-expected drop in the unemployment rate (3.8% has been suggested as a metric for full employment and the start of tightening) or sharper rise in average hourly earnings (e.g. more than 0.4% month-on-month) could drive the dollar higher today,” ING analysts added.Thanks to inflation running hotter than expected, fears of faster Fed rate hikes have gripped markets in recent weeks. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell retired the word transitory from inflation discussion and said that the central bank might consider speeding up the unwinding of asset purchases in December. On Thursday, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester told the Financial Times that the Omicron variant could fuel soaring inflation in the U.S. by further pressuring supply chains and worsening worker shortages.Story continuesBitcoin's daily chart (TradingView)Bitcoin’s bull run has lost steam in recent weeks, allowing a more than 15% pullback from record highs.The cryptocurrency is now looking to break out of a falling channel represented by trendlines connecting Nov. 10 and Nov. 15 highs and Nov. 6 and Nov. 19 lows.A weaker-than-expected payrolls figure would raise questions on the Fed’s ability to taper more quickly, perhaps pushing bitcoin, stocks and other risk assets higher. “Bitcoin’s correlation with S&P 500 increased amid the general market sell-off, strengthening our hypothesis that more sophisticated investors are currently not looking at bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, but as a risk-on asset,” Arcane Research’s weekly note published Tuesday said.Stuck in support zoneAccording to Glassnode, the cryptocurrency is currently trading in the support zone of $55,000 to $60,000 and may face resistance above $60,0000.The bitcoin market currently sits in one of the largest realized value clusters. Over 2.208 million BTC have last moved on-chain between $55,000 and $60,000,” Glassnode tweeted. “The next large cluster between $60,000 and $63,000 may act as resistance, whilst support can be found at $50,000 and again at $42,000.”Bitcoin's sits on one of the largest realised value clusters (Glassnode)","December 3, 2021, 2:25 AM"

Bitcoin remains in the range between the support at $56,000 and the resistance at $57,700, but it is slowly sliding towards the low end of this range. In case Bitcoin declines below the support at $56,000, selling pressure will likely intensify.Other cryptocurrencies show mixed dynamics today. Solana pulled back towards the $230 level while XRP found support near $0.96 and rebounded towards the $0.98 level. Shiba Inu managed to settle below the 50 EMA at $0.00004050 and is moving towards the support level at $0.000040 while Dogecoin is trying to get above the $0.21 level.Technical AnalysisEthereum has recently made another attempt to settle below the support level at $4,535 but failed to develop sufficient downside momentum. Currently, it is trying to develop upside momentum. RSI is in the moderate territory, and there is plenty of room to develop upside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.In case Ethereum manages to stay above the support at $4,535, it will move towards the resistance level at $4,650. A move above this level will push Ethereum towards the next resistance which is located at $4,770. If Ethereum gets above $4,770, it will head towards the resistance at $4,865.On the support side, Ethereum needs to get below the support at $4,535 to have a chance to develop downside momentum in the near term. The next support level for Ethereum is located at the 20 EMA at $4,390.In case Ethereum manages to settle below the 20 EMA, it will head towards the next support level at $4,200. A successful test of the support at $4,200 will open the way to the test of the next support which is located at the 50 EMA at $4,100.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.Story continuesThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Metaverse Land Sales on Major Blockchains Surpass $100M in a WeekStocks Move Higher After Disappointing Non Farm Payrolls ReportGBP/USD Daily Forecast – Another Test Of Support At 1.3280EUR/USD Daily Forecast – Test Of Support At 1.1300AUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis – Sellers Eyeing Long-Term Bottoms at .6991 and .6963Goldman Sachs Says Bitcoin’s Options Market Could Spur new Institutional Interest","December 3, 2021, 12:59 AM"

252,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senator-warren-targets-bitcoin-miner-011613318.html,Warren Targets Bitcoin Miner Greenidge’s Environmental Footprint,"U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) questioned the environmental footprint of Greenidge Generation’s (GREE) bitcoin mining operation in New York state in a detailed letter dated Thursday to the publicly traded company’s CEO, Jeffrey Kirt.In the letter, Warren told Kirt that she is concerned about the company’s energy usage and impact on the environment and consumers.“Given the extraordinarily high energy usage and carbon emissions associated with Bitcoin mining, mining operations at Greenidge and other plants raise concerns about their impacts on the global environment, on local ecosystems and on consumer electricity costs,” she wrote, asking for a detailed response by Dec. 17.Greenidge’s New York mining facility received lots of criticism earlier this year. Environmentalists objected to the power station burning natural gas to mine bitcoin as well as to its cooling system’s alleged impact on a local lake. In May, the company announced that it would counteract the emissions that its rigs produce with carbon offset credit purchases starting on June 1.Bitcoin miners use massive amounts of energy to power their operations. To combat this narrative, miners have recently been opting for more sustainable power sources.A recent survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry forum, found that sustainable power has grown to about 58% of the total used by the industry worldwide during the third quarter from 3% in the second quarter. The increase is partly due to the rapid expansion of North American mining amid  an exodus from China, and the shift to sustainable energy and better mining techniques.Yet Warren said that energy consumed by bitcoin miners matched that of Denmark, Chile, Argentina and Washington state. “Bitcoin’s estimated annual power consumption increased more than threefold between the beginning of 2019 and May 2021,” she wrote.The letter marks the first time Warren has requested information from a miner about its operations. “Dresden plant’s greenhouse gas emissions increased nearly tenfold from 2019 to 2020,” she wrote referring to the New York operation. “In 2020, it sent over 220,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere – equivalent to the emissions of 50,000 cars,” she added.Story continuesAt the time of publication, Greenidge had not responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comment.Greenidge bills itself as the “first and only carbon neutral, vertically integrated power generator and bitcoin miner of scale in the United States” on its website. The company is also building mining operations in Spartanburg, S.C., where it expects to start mining later this month or early next year.On Wednesday, Greenidge Generation said it plans to sell $35 million in senior notes, due in October 2026, which comes after the company raised $55.2 million in senior notes with similar terms on Oct. 13.","December 2, 2021, 5:16 PM"

The oldest cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume on centralized exchanges also declined.Data compiled by CoinDesk shows that bitcoin’s trading volume across 11 major centralized exchanges sank from a day ago and was much lower than a week ago. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell slightly but remained in the $4,500-$4,600 range.(CoinDesk/CryptoCompare)Meanwhile, the price for the USDT/CNY (tether/Chinese yuan) pair tumbled entering December,as the deadline approaches for Huobi, a popular crypto exchange among Chinese investors, to close the accounts of its existing users in mainland China. Amid China’s latest ban on crypto trading and mining, Huobi announced that it would remove all mainland Chinese accounts by the end of this year.As a previous Asia First Mover mentioned, the market in China has been slowly rebounding from the country’s September crypto trading ban with tether’s quoted prices in the yuan on the over-the-counter (OTC) market recovering from a deep discount.Under normal market conditions, the price of tether expressed in yuan should match that of the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate with the Asian currency, but tether had traded at a significant discount since China’s ban and turned into negative (as much as negative 5.31% yesterday) again after a brief recovery, according to data from feixiaohao.Story continuesTechnician’s takeBitcoin Struggles Near Resistance; Support at $53KBitcoin four-hour price chart shows support/resistance levels with RSI on bottom panel (Damanick Dantes/CoinDesk, TradingView)Bitcoin (BTC) continues to stabilize above the $53,000 support level after last month’s decline.There appears to be a stalemate, however, between buyers and sellers because the cryptocurrency is roughly flat over the past 24 hours. Resistance is seen around $60,000, which has capped upside moves over the past week.BTC was trading around $56,000 at the time of publication and is down about 4% over the past week.The short-term downtrend in BTC is defined by a series of lower price highs since Nov. 10, as seen in the chart above. Recently, oversold signals appeared on the charts, which could encourage short-term buying from the $53,00 support level. A decisive break above $60,000 would reverse the short-term downtrend.Still, there is strong overhead resistance between $60,000 and $65,000, which could limit price gains this month.Important events8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT (12:30 a.m. UTC): Jibun bank services purchasing managers index (Nov.)9:45 a.m. HKT/SGT (1:45 p.m. UTC): Caixin services purchasing managers index (Nov.)3:45 p.m. HKT/SGT (7:45 a.m. UTC): France industrial output (Oct.

Bar none. But he doesn’t think it works to buy coffee.“You don’t want to pay for your coffee with your bitcoin, you want to pay for your coffee with a currency,” Saylor said in an interview with CoinDesk TV on Tuesday.Saylor believes that bitcoin is the world reserve asset whereas the dollar is the world currency. That’s the main distinction between the two.Saylor’s MicroStrategy has doubled its bitcoin holdings in the fiscal fourth quarter this year and now owns 121,044 bitcoins worth about $3.6 billion, which he says that he will likely “hold forever.”Viewing bitcoin as an asset rather than as a currency also makes life easier from a regulatory perspective. “All of these regulations … they’re really regulations restraining your use of a digital asset as a currency rather than as a property,” Saylor said, adding that if you acknowledge that, it’s easy to see that the future of the industry is “quite bright.”Saylor also addressed the issue of inflation, saying that bitcoin would provide the best hedge against inflation.“There’s going to be volatility, but it seems to me that now we have universal acknowledgment that the world needs an inflation hedge,” he said. “So if you have bitcoin, don’t sell it.”","December 2, 2021, 3:21 PM"

It was trading at about $47,600 as of 1:50 p.m. in Singapore on Saturday, a drop of about 11%.Ether, the second-largest token, fell as much as 17.4% before trimming the retreat to about 10%. The overall crypto sector has shed around a fifth of its value, sliding to $2.2 trillion, according to tracker CoinGecko.The swings in cryptocurrencies come amid a volatile period for financial markets. Spiking inflation is forcing central banks to tighten monetary policy, threatening to reduce the liquidity tailwind that lifted a wide range of assets.The omicron variant of the coronavirus has also led to risk aversion over concerns about what it might mean for global economic reopening.Global stocks are down more than 4% from a record in November, while haven assets like Treasuries have rallied.Leveraged PositionsSome leveraged buyers of Bitcoin were flushed out in Saturday’s crash, according to Vijay Ayyar, head of Asia Pacific with crypto exchange Luno in Singapore.“Markets have also been jittery with all the uncertainty around omicron, with cases now appearing in many countries,” he said. “It’s hard to say what that means for economies and markets and hence the uncertainty.”About $2.4 billion of crypto exposure, both long and short, was liquidated on Saturday, the most since Sept. 7, according to data from Coinglass.com.Bitcoin, famed for its volatility, has shed about $21,000 since hitting a record on Nov. 10.But it’s still up more than 60% this year, a return that exceeds many other assets -- and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele said the country had again bought the dip, adding 150 coins. The nation this year adopted Bitcoin as legal tender.Story continues“As usual, since crypto traders deploy leverage it results in cascading sell orders and liquidations,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo. “We should find support around $40,000 to $42,000 and then rebound in line for a end-year rally.

263,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorsey-takes-square-deep-162751349.html,Jack Dorsey Takes Square Deep Down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole,"As we wrap up a year jam-packed with high-profile adoptions of crypto by big players, yesterday may have given us the concluding exclamation mark. Days after Jack Dorsey announced that he was stepping down as Twitter CEO, the other company Dorsey runs announced that it was changing its corporate name from “Square” to “Block.” For those who have been paying attention to Dorsey’s trajectory, the signal here could not be clearer.This article, part of CoinDesk’s Future of Money Week, is excerpted from The Node newsletter, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.Dorsey has spent the last five-odd years fascinated with cryptocurrency and blockchains, primarily Bitcoin. He has heavily promoted and supported the development of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and supported Bitcoin developers directly through a unit called Square Crypto (which will now be renamed, rather awesomely, Spiral). He added Bitcoin functionality to Square’s Cash App. At Twitter, he recently rolled out Lightning-based tipping, and before stepping down promised NFT (non-fungible token) avatar integration.Now he’s going to turn Square into an entire cryptocurrency and blockchain company. There’s little other serious way to evaluate the name change to “Block,” as in the transaction batches processed on blockchains. (Already taken: “The Block,” a cryptocurrency research and news outlet; Blockchain.com, a wallet and block explorer; Blockworks; BlockFi; Block.One. I could go on.)The potential here is huge. Square has a huge user base, between its small business checkout systems and consumer app. Its revenue from those two businesses has grown massively in recent years (though that growth has slowed recently), providing a firm financial and customer foundation. Dorsey will be able to look for real opportunities to improve those existing customer experiences with crypto. And his demonstrated commitment to public, open-access blockchains means those integrations will likely lift the whole sector.Story continuesStrangely, though, Square/Block seems to be downplaying the obvious “crypto” elements of the rebranding. The accompanying press release does list “blockchain” as a source of inspiration for the name, but includes it alongside pablum like “building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music”That’s a huge contrast to the other major name change of the past month, which saw Facebook becoming “Meta.” Facebook went full-court press on announcing that pivot, and it got a lot of press coverage.The difference is that Facebook was at least in part trying to change the conversation away from the regulatory and legal problems that have been bedeviling it. Another factor is that, frankly, the pivot from social media advertising to a virtual reality “metaverse” makes no sense financially, so Zuckerberg and company knew they had to wow the credulous rubes in the mainstream press with barbecue sauce jokes.Square, by contrast, is a successful company that does not regularly facilitate crimes against humanity. There’s no reason to think the name change is a PR play. In fact, Square’s hesitation to talk about the name change in terms of “crypto” makes it clear it sees risk in the opposite direction: Square investors at this point know that they’re holding a growth company with an established model and might very well get squirrely if it seemed like Dorsey was about to turn it into his personal blockchain playpen.This morning’s market seems to reflect that ambivalence: As the new world gestates in the flesh of the old, Block is trading flat.","December 2, 2021, 2:36 PM"

Some analysts are concerned that rising leverage in the bitcoin futures market could precede a near-term price drop, while others expect the current trading range to result in further upside.CryptoQuant analysts pointed to the slower pace of whales, or large bitcoin buyers, buying as a cautious market signal. Meanwhile, technical indicators suggest bitcoin’s price decline could stabilize at around $53,000, although upside appears to be limited beyond $60,000-$65,000.With the end of year approaching, some analysts told CoinDesk that most investors will probably exit their long positions to lock in gains, which could make a sustained price rise to $100,000 BTC unlikely.Latest pricesBitcoin (BTC): $56,974, +0.5%Ether (ETH): $4,532, -0.7%S&P 500: +1.4%Gold: $1,769, -0.8%10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.436%Concerns about rising leverageOpen interest, or the total number of outstanding contracts, in the bitcoin futures market continues to rise despite the recent crypto sell-off.“It is not common to see such a high open interest being sustained for such a long duration.

Governments around the world are now trying to regulate the crypto space and ensure that innovation continues to thrive.The UK Needs to Adopt CryptocurrenciesPhilip Hammond, a British politician who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 2016 to 2019, has pointed out that the UK needs to adopt cryptocurrencies. According to Hammond, digital assets could ease the post-Brexit financial disruption and ensure that London remains a global financial hub.For decades, London has been the financial hub of Europe. It is home to some of the leading financial companies in the region, including Revolut, Wise and several others. However, the UK is going through a financial disruption following the Brexit saga.In a recent interview with City A.M., a former member of the Conservative Party said the UK needs to move fast and adopt cryptocurrencies. “I personally think the momentum is now unstoppable. We need to move quickly and effectively to secure London’s position,” he added.Hammond argued that the UK adopting cryptocurrencies would ensure that London remains a global financial hub as Bitcoin and the altcoins will become increasingly employed on a macroeconomic level.He argued that ignoring cryptocurrencies and other digital assets is not wise since numerous European nations have begun embracing them. Hammond said the competitors now see cryptocurrencies as an avenue to overtake the UK in the financial space.The BOE is Not a Crypto FanThe Bank of England, like most central banks around the world, has shown that they are not a big fan of cryptocurrencies. Last month, BOE governor Andrew Bailey said that the rise of crypto assets was helping illegal activity.Bailey also cast doubt on stablecoins, stating that he doesn’t believe they can evolve into a form of safe, regulated money. Regardless, cryptocurrencies continue to gain adoption, and their use cases will grow bigger.Story continuesThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:London’s Role as a Financial Hub is Secure if UK Adopts CryptocurrenciesS&P 500 Price Forecast – Stock Markets Continue to Show WeaknessEthereum, Litecoin, and Ripple’s XRP – Daily Tech Analysis – December 4th, 2021USD/CAD: Loonie Pares Losses After Hitting 10-Week Low on Strong Domestic Jobs DataCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Volatile Week Ends Somewhat UnchangedNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Edge Higher Forming Inside Day","December 3, 2021, 12:01 PM"

Since then, the value of the asset has enjoyed massive adoption and growth that has pushed its price to its current ATH of above $68k.Bitcoin Could Crash to $10kHowever, one top money manager, Louis Navellier, recently made a shocking price prediction that is sending some shock waves down the spine of many crypto enthusiasts and the community at large. According to him, the value of the flagship digital asset could crash to as low as $10k, if a certain situation were to happen.Per Navellier, Bitcoin could see an 80% downward trend if the flagship crypto-asset forms a scary double-top pattern; it would send the asset price lower to hit below the $28k mark, and at that time, it would be signaling the end for bulls. Peradventure the double-top pattern surfaces, this would mean that Bitcoin would be journeying into zones last visited over a year ago.I would take a decline below $46,000 (the 200-day moving average) to be a yellow flag and a decline below the spring low of $28,500 to be a completed massive double top which points to a decline to below $10,000, which incidentally would match many of the multiple 80%+ declines in its storied history.Bitcoin Once Crashed by Over 80% in 2018Although this prediction looks ridiculous for the crypto king, it is not an entirely new phenomenon as the asset once experienced a price correction of about 84% when its value crashed from a high of $20000 in December 2018.Louis Navellier is the Founder and Chairman of a $2.5 billion asset management firm, Navellier $ Associates, in Reno, Nevada. He gives market analysis on leading media houses like Bloomberg, CNBC, and Fox News.He also believes that the U.S Federal Reserve’s bond purchase could provide the biggest boost for Bitcoin.The Fed is tapering, and this should create a correction in risk assets, of which bitcoin is a part.

The U.S. crypto exchange noted that overall market performance could be mixed heading into the U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Dec. 14-15.“The steady unwinding of monetary accommodation in 2022 points to both lower returns for equities and losses for bonds, and greater volatility than over the past 20 months,” MRB Partners, a global investment research firm, wrote in a Friday report.Ether takes a breatherEther, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, continues to struggle below its all-time price high of $4,865.

Total trading volume reached $15 billion as of October, Defiance said.""The NFT revolution will fundamentally change the economic model for artists, athletes, creators, and many more industries that we can't even conceive of today."" Defiance Co-Founder and Chief Investment Officer Sylvia Jablonski said in a statement to Insider. ""NFTs could be bigger than the internet.""The fund goes beyond NFTs, though. Its companies are ""key players"" to building the metaverse, Bloomberg wrote, citing Jablonski. The metaverse, a digital world where people can interact, has been dubbed the next phase of the internet. And some have said NFTs and blockchain technology are the key to unlocking it.Some of the fund's biggest investments include fintech banking company Silvergate, crypto miners Marathon Digital Holdings and Bitfarms, and crypto-exchange Coinbase, among others. After launching Thursday, NFTZ fell 2.5% to $23.50 at 12:01 p.m. in New York.A number of crypto and Web3 ETFs have debuted this year. The Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF has seen its inflows surge more than six-fold, since the company formerly known as Facebook rebranded to Meta in the hopes of moving into the virtual world. The fund started with just a few million dollars in June and now has $823.2 million in assets, Insider reported. In October, the first-ever bitcoin-related ETF in the US began trading and enjoyed a huge debut.Read the original article on Business Insider","December 2, 2021, 10:33 AM"

However, like other altcoins in the top-ten ones by market capitalization, the price is finding dynamic resistance around the 50-period simple moving average at the H4 chart.The selling pressure from the highs of December 10 is still high across the board, as the impulsive construction to the downside looks forward to cracking lower below $0.90.XRP’s Rollercoaster in 2021The 200-period simple moving average also provides guidance to the bears in the short term and the RSI indicator.Once the level of $0.90 gives up in favor of the sellers, there are higher chances for XRP to extend the bearish bias and eventually plummet towards the $0.85 level in a first instance, followed by the $0.78 level.However, an interesting formation is underway in the cryptocurrency, which has witnessed a rollercoaster in terms of sentiment due to the tussles between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).200 SMA as the Line in the Sand for the BullsIn fact, a possible trend reversal is on the cards as the price tries to develop a higher low at this stage, and once it breaks above the recent highs around $1.03, doors will open for the altcoin to skyrocket towards the 200 SMA around the $1.10 level in a first degree.XRP’s volume profile shows high buying activity – Source: FXEMPIREStill, XRP could face a dynamic resistance around that zone, and once it gets cleared out by the bulls, another bull run is set to take place towards the $1.20 area.XRP should then pierce above $1.25 to confirm a golden crossover with the 200 SMA and trigger a bullish signal, together with an RSI indicator aligned with the bulls at the H4 chart, heading the crypto towards the $1.35 level.Such a level is an interesting zone from an on-chain perspective, where addresses actively purchase XRP coins.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Ripple (XRP) Is Poised To Make a Trend Reversal That Favors BuyersMeta to Allow More Crypto Adverts on Facebook and InstagramWill India Ban Cryptos?

271,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dogecoin-sink-further-owners-profits-173402619.html,Dogecoin Will Sink Further as Owners Take Profits or Losses for the Year,"Dogecoin (CCC:DOGE-USD) has had a rough time this past month. It is down 21% from 26.79 cents on Nov. 1 to 21.16 cents as of mid-day Dec. 2. Dogecoin is also down significantly in the past two months, almost 29% from 29.6 cents on Sept. 1. Unfortunately, Dogecoin could be facing more of this turbulence, especially as we get closer to the end of the year.A concept image of Dogecoin (DOGE) with the Shiba Inu and text on a gold token.Source: ShutterstockOne reason for this is profit-taking by people who have made a large gain. They might not want to take further degradation in their unrealized profits. So they sell before the end of the year in order to prevent having to potentially higher taxes on the gains next year.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsNew Version Could Lower FeesHowever, there is some good news on the horizon.According to Cryptoslate magazine, a new core version of the Dogecoin blockchain was released recently.One of the advantages of this new core version will be to lower transaction fees. The update will enable third-party wallets to support cheaper transaction fees, improve security for wallets, and upgrade the blockchain’s performance.7 Stocks to Buy to Hedge Against Rising Oil PricesThe new version was released on Nov. 9 to immediate fanfare. The update 1.14.5 is “a new minor version release” according to a GitHub note. According to a recent note in Ambcrypto, 98% of the Dogecoin nodes had already adopted this upgrade as of Nov. 9.The only problem is that as of this point in time, Dogecoin’s price already discounts all the benefits of this minor upgrade. In other words, Dogecoin’s price has already reaped the benefits from this upgrade. So, it likely isn’t going to go up again much this year.Where This Leaves DogecoinTherefore, this leaves us more concerned about investors taking profits before year-end. After all, Dogecoin is now 37 times the price where it ended on Dec. 31, 2020, at $0.005685 (i.e., at over one-half of one cent).However, in the last six months, when Dogecoin was at 42.34 cents, it had some value to entice investors to buy it, but now it is down slightly over 50%. That could easily be motivation for many people to take losses to offset against their other short-term gains. After all, many other cryptos have also had huge gains for the year.Story continuesThe point I am making is that anyone who bought Dogecoin after mid-April and held on until now likely has a short-term loss. This is because after mid-April Dogecoin basically rose for a while and then went on an extended tumble up until now.This loss can be offset against any other short-term gains if both securities are sold before the end of the year. I suspect that this fact will drive a lot of the performance of Dogecoin between now and the end of the year.What To Do With Dogecoin NowAs a result, Dogecoin could be vulnerable to tax-loss selling through most of December. The reason is that come January, an investor who took short-term losses can buy back again after 31 days and avoid the wash sale loss rules.This especially matters at the end of the year when most people file their calendar year tax returns. (Keep in mind here that I am not a financial planner and this is not investment advice for any person).Therefore, most potential investors in Dogecoin will likely want to wait until most of this tax-loss selling is out of the way. That might mean waiting until closer to the end of the month before buying Dogecoin again.This is often what happens with stocks that have shot up early in the year and then wane for most of the rest of the year. The end-of-year tax harvesting becomes a huge force that is hard for the crypto or asset trading to overcome without any major news.On the date of publication, Mark R.

275,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aligning-social-financial-capital-create-172046682.html,Aligning Social and Financial Capital to Create Better Money,"Money is on most of our minds. But what would it look like and mean in the future? Before we think about the future, let’s take a very brief look at what money means and its history.The textbook explanation of money is a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. This definition, although accurate, doesn’t explain the human perception of money. Money is a social construct where we all agree on its use. It’s coveted as a tool to ensure security for your lifestyle, influence others and signal importance.Imran Ahmed is the founder of Koru Finance. This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.Barter (or is it?)A common story we are told is that money arises from the insufficiency of barter. Known as the “double coincidence of wants” problem, it is said barter was too limiting and a more flexible medium of exchange was needed. According to anthropologist David Graeber in his book, “Debt: The First 5000 Years,” this story is not true. To summarize his findings in ancient societies, what was found as “money” was delayed barter. For example, I don’t need item A now but I may need it in the future. I will give you item B and ask for A when I need it. This was the first creation of credit.Barter, however, was necessary for dealing with strangers outside of your community because claiming credit from strangers was not possible. This was a weakness that limited foreign trade. Another weakness was scalability of trust; in the case of tribes, the number of people interacting with each other was small enough to be managed. But in the case of a country, the web of trust limits the parties available to trade with. To trade within a nation, the currency used must allow for trade with members outside of close circles of trust.Commodity moneyA “universal” agreement of value that allowed people to transact without knowing each other was needed. The agreement took the form of many things such as salt, cod and tulips, for example, but the easiest to remember is the use of gold. The problem with commodities was their inability to keep pace with an economy. The limited supply among a growing population and productivity meant instability and deflation. In other words, if the supply stays the same as more people need it, then there is less to go around. This stifles economic activity by not having enough to trade. The demand for the money drives up the purchasing power of currency and reduces the prices of goods and services which reduces production. The reduction of production means the loss of employment.Story continuesFiat moneyAfter departing from the gold standard, countries had national banks oversee the creation of money via commercial banks. Money bills are issued by the government; however, most of the money in current economies is digitally managed by commercial banks. This money is written into law as legal tender, effectively making the money as strong as the government. This type of money is called “fiat money” from the Latin word fiat, meaning “let it be done.”The problem with this arrangement is the centralization of economic power. This was intended for banks to determine the creditworthiness of citizens and responsibly create money. As these institutions profit by lending, there is a heavy incentive to keep on lending and compete by risk exposure. These incentives lead to systemic issues and mismanagement as seen in the 2008 financial crisis.Compared to previously mentioned deferred barter, as social capital is misaligned with financial capital the only way to capture risk is via interest.The effects of interest have significant negative impacts. By being in the business of lending, customers must continuously be indebted. This incentivizes the growth of wealth inequality by having interest compounding on debts and creating money for only those that can already afford it.The future of moneyAs we envision the future trajectory of money, we can start by highlighting desirable traits and then building on lessons learned from previous systems:Currency stability via flexible money supply: The prices of goods and services are not heavily swayed by the scarcity of money. All prior monetary systems primarily aimed for this trait.Collectively managed by a social contract: The management of money supply should belong to the people. This also can preserve the citizen’s economic agency.Pluralistic and adapted to local conditions: In the case of a single commodity, certain areas will be endowed with large deposits leading to inherently unequal distribution. For credit based systems, the system should be able to match the actual value being exchanged for goods and services in its region of circulation.Decentralized and transparent: To avoid mismanagement, centralization needs to be balanced with transparency to allow sufficient oversight.What if we had a system that allowed liquidity to be created/destroyed as needed with democratic oversight? Instead of having money trickle down via a chain of institutions, what if we could “print” it so long as we followed the rules everyone had decided on – a system that is truly decentralized and aimed toward empowering all?As it turns out there is a name for this: mutual credit.Also part of Future of Money Week:The Transhumanist Case for Crypto – Daniel KuhnShiba Inu: Memes Are the Future of Money - David Z. Morris7 Wild Scenarios for the Future of Money - Jeff WilserThe Downside of Programmable Money - Marc HochsteinEthereum in 2022: What Is Money in the Metaverse? - Edward OosterbaanMutual credit systems (MCS) are a generalized IOU network to be used as a medium of exchange. An example would be Alice paying Bob for bread. Alice’s account is debited 20 (balance = -20) and Bob’s account is credited 20 (balance = +20). Notice how there was no fiat money used here; it was “created” out of trust between Alice and Bob. In an MCS, members accept the money created between Alice and Bob. This means Bob can spend Alice’s credit for other goods and services. No bank was needed here and the credit created here has zero interest to prevent those holding debts from using that debt as a way to accrue wealth. The community trusts its members to honor their promises and bear the risks together.Mutual credit systems have historically had their own weaknesses, however. They have yet to be adapted for the 21st century by leveraging the internet, communication and cryptographic technology. At Koru we are building what we believe to be the future of monetary systems by infusing mutual credit with modern technology.But what about bitcoin? An oversimplification of bitcoin would be to call it “digital gold.” It artificially creates scarcity to derive value and exists on a trustless network. In many ways bitcoin has many similarities to commodities in both strengths and weaknesses. Bitcoin allows transactions between unknown members; however, its supply is not dynamic enough to match an economy, which makes it deflationary.Other altcoins have a more dynamic supply, but we have seen the same issue of deflation and speculation making them unsuitable for stability. Algorithmic stablecoins are very promising; however, they are pegged to a national currency, making them unsuitable as money replacements unless they find a better peg.Bitcoin sees trust as an issue and employs an algorithm to manage the supply to enable trustless payments. Koru sees trust as a human feature, but the allocation of trust should be decentralized instead of held and managed by institutions. In reality, there is a right tool for every job, which is why Koru is designed to work with other cryptocurrencies to cover cases where trust is not possible.Beyond moneyMoney is often entwined with politics and economics, the reason being that many desire to accrue wealth. The obsession with money has led to many issues among ourselves. One can only hope that the future is a place where consumption is balanced and the primary objective is not to acquire money. In the case of Koru, the store of value is not reflected in your bank balance but rather in your reputation of creditworthiness among your peers. Therefore to invest in your community is to invest into yourself. This may have an effect of moving today’s perception of security, influence and importance via money to your community.By aligning social capital with financial capital, we hope humans will be focused on helping their neighbors rather than extracting an imaginary value known as money.(Kevin Ross/CoinDesk)","December 2, 2021, 9:20 AM"

The approach Filecoin has taken is to estimate energy use and assume the energy is not renewable until it has been verified through Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs). This involves matching energy use to renewable energy generation on the same power grid.Crypto’s carbon footprintStepping back, Filecoin Green’s mission is to measure environmental impacts across a more decentralized internet, and allow people in different positions in the value chain (such as storage providers or miners) to mitigate those impacts. At its core is a reputation system designed to be both verifiable and interoperable in a way that wasn’t possible in Web 2, Ransil says.Hardened Bitcoiners, weary of fielding energy consumption critics, are probably rolling their eyes by now – that’s if they’ve even read this far. But Filecoin has more in common with Bitcoin than you might think.Read more: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy DebateFilecoin uses a proof-of-storage consensus system, in which energy use is linked to a valuable resource people are providing that is central to the entire enterprise: storing files and verifying over time that those files are stored.Story continues“There’s no proof-of-stake version in which the energy to store files goes to zero,” Ransil said, alluding to the non-mining consensus mechanism used to secure newer blockchain networks. “Using Filecoin is always going to use a fair amount of energy. So we want to set up our ecosystem to demand renewable energy. It should make us a player in energy markets, and act as a strategic wedge to push green power grids.”Ransil pointed out that Filecoin has taken a different strategy from the way people make renewable energy claims right now in proof-of-work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin. The latter’s claims tend to be based on surveys, which are then taken as representative of the entire network.“This is interesting data to have as a starting point,” Ransil said. “But in an industry dedicated to rigorous verifiability we should aim for actual renewable energy use to be certified and publicly proven.”","December 2, 2021, 6:01 AM"

The ETF's bitcoin sub-custodian, Fidelity Clearing Canada. will acquire and hold bitcoin and investors will be able to buy and sell it on the Toronto Stock Exchange.ETFs backed by physically settled bitcoin are available in Europe, as well as Canada, where regulators approved those funds in February this year. In August, French regulators let asset manager Melanion Capital list a spot bitcoin ETF of its own.""We believe that cryptocurrency is a valid asset class that we would like to provide as an investment option for retail investors in Canada by including this in our product offering,"" a spokesperson from Fidelity Investments Canada told Insider.US investors only have access to bitcoin-futures ETFs for now. Fidelity filed  to list a spot bitcoin ETF in the US back in March, but has not got approval to do so at this point. So far, US regulators have approved bitcoin futures ETFs run by ProShares, Valkyrie and VanEck.Fidelity opted to offer a bitcoin spot ETF over a futures one because bitcoin futures are generally in ""contango"" which means the futures price is higher than the spot price of the underlying asset, which means investors can lose money when they roll their positions.Story continuesThe company also said bitcoin futures ETFs may suffer from capacity constraints due to limits on the number of futures contracts an ETF is permitted to hold at any given time.Fidelity's history with digital assets traces back to 2014, when it began research and development efforts into blockchain technology through the Fidelity Centre of Applied Technology.Some analysts believed Fidelity listing a bitcoin ETF in Canada was a blow to regulators in America.""This should be embarrassing for the SEC that one of America's biggest, most storied names in investing is forced to go up North to serve its clients,"" Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas said on Twitter.Crypto giant Grayscale, which filed for a spot bitcoin ETF in October, sent a letter to the SEC on Monday saying it had no basis to approve bitcoin futures ETFs and not spot ones and by doing so violated the Administrative Protections Act (APA).Read the original article on Business Insider","December 2, 2021, 5:36 AM"

This means the SEC must treat similarly situated investment products similarly.”What the law saysPer Ishan Pandey, an associate at KARM Legal Consultants, in his interpretation of the subject matter, “the courts may compel SEC actions under Section 706 (1) of APA as unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed. Under this section, the court can find the actions of the SEC unlawful and set aside SEC actions, findings and conclusions.”Story continuesHe continued that the commission might find it difficult to build its case against Grayscale because its “current reasons for rejecting such applications are based on subjective opinions and not based on the standing of laws.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.This position is also shared by popular crypto lawyer Jake Chervinsky who in a tweet said that “now that bitcoin futures ETFs are live, the SEC has no valid justification for denying @Grayscale’s spot ETF application. The Administrative Procedures Act demands approval. It’s time.”SEC’s Position on Bitcoin ETFs ApprovalBefore the ascension of Gary Gensler as the chairman of the SEC, the commission had always rejected all crypto-related ETFs applications before it.However, since he took over office, the chairman has hinted that the commission could approve a futures-backed ETF rather than the one which would grant direct exposure to the digital asset.According to the SEC, its reluctance to approve a BTC spot ETF is tied to its effort to better protect investors from the volatile nature of the flagship digital asset.It should be noted that the commission has approved a number of Bitcoin futures ETFs like that of ProShares, VanEck and Valkyrie.

The agency delayed its decision in June and again in July, as well as its consideration of other bitcoin spot ETFs.“The Commission concludes that BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirement that the rules of a national securities exchange be ‘designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’ and ‘to protect investors and the public interest,’” the agency wrote.The SEC’s decision was not unexpected as SEC Chair Gary Gensler has indicated multiple times in the past a preference for a bitcoin futures ETF over an ETF that holds bitcoin directly. Last month, the SEC rejected investment firm VanEck’s proposal for a spot bitcoin ETF.Two bitcoin futures ETFs, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) and the Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BTF), began trading in the U.S. in October, leading to a significant rally in the price of bitcoin.

BTC traded below the $57,000 and $56,000 levels. It traded close to $55,500 before the bulls appeared. The price is now correcting losses and trading above $56,000. The first hurdle for the bulls could be $57,000, but the main hurdle is still near $58,000. A proper H4 close above $58,000 is must for a move towards the $60,000 level.If the bulls fail, the price could resume decline below $55,500. The next key support is near $55,000, below which there is a risk of a move towards the $53,500 level.Ether (ETH)Ether failed to stay in the bullish zone after it failed to clear the $4,800 level. There was a bearish reaction below the $4,650 and $4,600 levels. Ether price even moved below $4,500 briefly before recovering higher. It is now facing resistance near the $4,600 level. The next key barrier is $4,720, above which the price could revisit the $4,800 resistance zone.If there is another decline, the price could decline towards the $4,500 level. The next key support is near $4,420. A downside break below $4,420 may perhaps push the price to $4,200.Polygon (MATIC)MATIC started a fresh increase after it formed a base above the $1.60 level. There was a strong upward move above the $1.80 resistance. During the increase, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $1.85 on the 4-hours chart.The price even spiked above the $2.00 resistance level. It tested the $2.20 resistance zone and is currently correcting lower. It traded below the $2.10 level, and even broke the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1.50 swing low to $2.20 high.However, the price is still above the $2.00 level and the 21 simple moving average (H4). An initial support on the downside is near the $2.00 zone. The first major support sits near the $1.85 level or the 21 simple moving average (H4).Story continuesThe 50% Fib retracement level of the recent increase from the $1.50 swing low to $2.20 high is also near the $1.85 level. On the upside, MATIC is now facing resistance near the $2.05 level. A close above the $2.05 and $2.10 levels may perhaps send the price towards the $2.20 high. Any more gains could set the tone for a move towards the $2.50 level or even a new all-time high.ADA, BNB, and DOT priceCardano (ADA) started a decent increase after it cleared the $1.62 resistance. It even broke the $1.70 level and is trading in a positive zone. The next major resistance above is $1.72, above which it could revisit $1.80.

While analysts are bullish on the cryptocurrency, they don’t foresee a rally to six figures in the short term.“The latest Commitment of Traders report shows net-long positioning on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with an increased commitment by asset managers,” said Laurent Kssis, a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) expert and director of CEC Capital. The report was released on Friday. “Having said that, it won’t be enough to commit to the $100,000 rally this month as everyone is/was predicting.”Ksiss said the cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to price pullbacks fueled by leverage washouts. “As much as the long-term trend remains positive, short-term pressures and liquidations, due to higher leverage being offered, remain high and will continue to put pressure on BTC price,” Kssis added.While bitcoin futures open interest (OI) in U.S. dollar terms has recently declined along with the cryptocurrency’s price, the metric remains high when measured in BTC terms, indicating excess leverage in the market. Open interest refers to the number of contracts traded but not liquidated with offsetting positions.“The bitcoin denominated OI has now remained above 365,000 BTC for more than a month,” Arcane Research’s weekly noted published Tuesday said. “It is not common to see such a high OI being sustained for such a long duration. This could suggest that the market is currently over-saturated with leverage.”Another signal: Open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a proxy for institutional activity, has declined alongside a pick-up in activity in the retail-focused Bybit exchange. In the past, increased activity on Bybit has paved the way for price pullbacks.“Bybit’s share of the global open interest in the bitcoin futures has remained at high levels throughout November. Previously, Bybit’s OI has seen huge booms and busts as trades get crowded,” Arcane Research noted.Story continuesWhile a continued decline of liquid supply in the market leaves the door open for an outsize rally on large buy orders, a renewed institutional participation ahead of the new year looks unlikely.“With the end of year fast approaching, most investors will probably unwind their risk-on position allowing them to present decent yearly performances,” Kssis said. “We do not see a bull run in 2021.”Over 75% of supply can be considered illiquid at press time, according to Glassnode data. Illiquid supply is defined as the number of coins held in addresses that spend less than 25% of their incoming coins.Matthew Dibb, COO and co-founder of Stack Funds, said the chance of bitcoin rallying to $100,000 is getting slimmer by the day as the macroeconomic environment doesn’t appear price supportive, especially with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s recent hawkish turn. The central bank could discuss speeding up the bond-buying taper or scaling back of asset purchases at the December meeting, Powell said earlier this week.“While we are bullish for the short term, there is growing doubt that $100,000 will be hit,” Dibb said. “Renewed interest is, however, being shown in ether and other coins associated with layer 1 blockchains.”While bitcoin is down 1.4% this week, ether has risen around 5%. The ether-bitcoin (ETH/BTC) ratio has broken out of its multimonth consolidation, signaling ether leadership ahead or rotation of money out of bitcoin and into ether and other alternative cryptocurrencies in coming weeks.“Right now, ETH is looking poised to make new highs vs. BTC – something we haven’t seen since the ICO mania of 2017,” David Hoffman, founder of the Bankless newsletter, noted. “One theme that we’ve seen throughout Ethereum’s history is that the ETH/BTC chart goes up in bull markets and down during bear markets.”Hoffman added that the ratio’s potential break above 0.80 would bring another “wild period in crypto markets.” ETH/BTC is currently trading near the 0.80 mark on Binance.“A bull run to $100,000 looks unlikely as there could be a major altcoin rally later this month,” MintingM, a Mumbai-based crypto asset management company, said.Still, MintingM said bitcoin might surprise everyone if a major company or country accepts it as a means of payment or the U.S. Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) approves a spot-based ETF.According to historical data, bitcoin could rally to around $73,000 – about $29% above the current price of $56,400, should the macro situation improve and ether picks up a strong bid, lifting the entire market higher.“The average return from Thanksgiving until year-end has been 29%, with a powerful 72% rally in 2020,” Jeff Dorman, CIO at Arca, said in a blog post published Monday.","December 2, 2021, 4:54 AM"

The 100 EMA pulled away from the 200, however, adding further downward pressure.Through the afternoon, a bearish cross of the 50 through the 200 and the 100 EMAs would bring sub-$56,000 support levels into play.For the bulls, a move through the day’s pivot and a return to $58,500 levels would be key to avoid another sell-off.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:USD/CAD Daily Forecast – Test Of Resistance At 1.2825EUR/USD Mid-Session Technical Analysis for December 2, 2021Stocks Try To Rebound After Yesterday’s Sell-OffGBP/USD Price Forecast – British Pound Rallies Yet AgainAUD/USD Price Forecast – Australian Dollar Continues to SlumpWholesale Inflation Drives the EUR Northwards ahead of U.S Jobless Claims","December 2, 2021, 3:38 AM"

Fallon/Getty ImagesCathie Wood said Wednesday the metaverse is set to become a multitrillion-dollar market.The Ark Invest boss told CNBC it will likely touch every sector ""in ways that we cannot even imagine right now.""Her comments come as parcels of land in the metaverse are selling for millions of dollars.Cathie Wood is no stranger to big calls – and she's just made another huge one.The Ark Invest founder and CEO told CNBC Wednesday she thinks the metaverse will be a multitrillion-dollar opportunity that will impact every part of the economy.""It's a big idea that will probably infiltrate — just like technology is, anyway — every sector in ways that we cannot even imagine right now,"" she told Sara Eisen in a CNBC Pro Talk.The metaverse is capturing the attention of many investors right now. It's a catch-all term that refers to various virtual worlds, where users in the form of avatars can play games, work, and build things. In some worlds, people can earn cryptocurrency and trade crypto collectibles known as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.The most well-known iterations of the metaverse right now are games such as Fortnite and Roblox. Yet hype is building up around other projects: in The Sandbox metaverse, a parcel of land just sold for $4.3 million.Facebook has renamed itself Meta and announced a focus on building virtual worlds, which it thinks will be the future of the internet.Asked on CNBC whether she thinks the metaverse can become a multitrillion-dollar market, Wood said: ""We do.""She added: ""We're going to have our digital twins, and it's going to enable a lot of fun and a lot of efficiencies.""Yet the superstar investor said she thinks the metaverse will expand massively, away from the current focus on gaming and consumer goods such as so-called virtual skins in Fortnite.Read more: Execs at Hasbro, Playboy, Prada, and more are laying out their 'metaverse' plans.

""I think this is much more than just a consumer idea,"" she said.Wood shot to investing stardom in 2020 by making big bets on Tesla and other fast-growing technology companies. Ark Invest's Innovation ETF rose more than 140% in 2020, when tech stocks soared as governments and central banks pumped cash into economies.However, Wood's bets have been less successful in 2021, as investors have favored stocks that tend to do better when economic growth and inflation are stronger, such as energy companies and banks. The Ark Innovation ETF is down around 20% for the year, while the Ark Genomic Revolution ETF is down more than 35%.Despite some investors' excitement about the metaverse, many are skeptical, pointing out that people have played games in virtual worlds for years, and so the idea is far from revolutionary.Raj Gokal, co-founder of cryptocurrency network solana, tweeted last week: ""I worry that the metaverse is overhyped (industry-wide).

Tesla Inc, its largest holding, shed nearly 4%, while Teladoc Health Inc, its second-largest holding, dropped 5.2%.ARK, whose outsized holding of so-called stay at home stocks helped it outperform all other U.S. equity funds last year, is down 25% over the last month. Those declines have come as investors increasingly anticipate that the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates in the year ahead, which would weigh on growth stocks by discounting their future cash flows.Friday’s declines may have been bolstered by a U.S. employment report showing that the U.S. economy added 210,000 jobs last month, pushing the unemployment rate to a 21-month low of 4.2%.""Ultimately the lower unemployment rate could help build confidence that the economic growth we've been seeing will continue regardless of what happens with Omicron, and that will push investors out into small-caps and cyclicals instead of the stay at home and technology trades,"" said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Tuesday that the central bank is open to accelerating the pace of its tapering program, essentially removing its support of the economy faster than it originally anticipated.Friday's declines pushed the ARK Innovation fund down 24.5% for the year to date, well behind the roughly 20% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 over the same time.Roku Inc, for instance, dropped 4.1% Friday, leaving it down nearly 40% for the year to date, while Spotify Technology SA fell 1.4%, leaving it down 28.3% for the year to date.ARK Invest did not respond to a request for comment for this story.(Reporting by David Randall in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)","December 3, 2021, 9:38 AM"

Bitcoin has recently made another attempt to settle below the support at $56,000. If Bitcoin gets below this level, it may gain strong downside momentum and quickly get to the test of the next support at $53,600 which will be bearish for crypto markets.Solana made an attempt to settle above $236 but lost momentum and declined below the $225 level. XRP managed to settle below $1.00 and tried to get below $0.95. Meme coins are also under pressure. Dogecoin is testing the support level at $0.2050 while Shiba Inu is trying to settle back below the 50 EMA at $0.00004260.Technical AnalysisEthereum tested the support level at $4,535, but this test yielded no results. The upside trend stays strong, and Ethereum will have a good chance to get to the test of all-time high levels in case global market sentiment improves.The nearest resistance level for Ethereum is located at $4,650. If Ethereum gets above this level, it will move towards the next resistance at $4,770. A successful test of this level will push Ethereum towards the resistance at $4,865.On the support side, a move below $4,535 will open the way to the test of the support level which is located at the 20 EMA at $4,375. In case Ethereum declines below this level, it will head towards the next support at $4,200.

That’s nearly 10 times larger than the average trade size of $2,000 to $4,000 seen on centralized exchanges (CEXs).The daily trade count on CEXs, however, tallies into the millions while major DEXs process fewer than 50,000 deals per day, with Curve and Balancer V1 averaging fewer than 1,000 traders per day.Kaiko analysts attributed whale dominance to the high transaction costs on Ethereum, the world’s largest blockchain for smart contracts.“The large trades are likely due to Ethereum’s high transaction fees, which prevents more retail traders from using DEXs,” Kaiko’s weekly research note said. “Every trader on a DEX must pay Ethereum transaction fees for each trade, which frequently surpass $100 due to congestion and scalability issues.”According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, DeFi’s growing popularity in wealthier countries is the main reason for DEXs processing much larger transactions than centralized platforms.While several smart contract platforms facilitating cheaper and faster transactions such as Avalanche, Binance Chain, Polkadot and Solana have emerged over the past 12 months, Ethereum still leads the pack.The total value locked in Ethereum-based DeFi applications stands at $178.5 billion. That’s more than nine times greater than Binance Chain’s TVL of $19.25 billion, data provided by Defi Llama shows.","December 1, 2021, 11:58 PM"

Many affected users report that while claiming yield farming rewards and interacting with Badger vaults, they noticed their wallet providers prompting spurious requests for additional permissions.“It looks like a bunch of users had approvals set for the exploit address allowing [the address] to operate on their vault funds and that was exploited,” wrote Badger core contributor Tritium on Discord.“Once we noticed we froze all the vaults so nothing can move and are trying to figure out where the approvals came from, how many people have them, and what next steps are,” he added.The team also confirmed the exploit on Twitter:This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.A Badger representative did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.Though the contracts are paused, community members are advising that depositors use tools like Debank and Unrekt to revoke permissions for the malicious contract.At the time of writing BadgerDAO’s BADGER token is down 17% over 24 hours to $22.32 per token.UPDATE (Dec. 2, 11:10 UTC): Updates estimate of amount stolen, token price.","December 1, 2021, 8:51 PM"

The effort will fund a project on Cocos Island off the coast of Costa Rica, supporting local nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and park ranger operations.Read more: Artists Back ‘Green’ NFT Sale Citing Concerns Over Crypto’s Environmental ImpactOceanDrop, which is supported by the likes of SuperRare, DoinGud and RNDR, is attempting to push the envelope on NFT innovation. All the digital artworks and animations in the sale will feature holograms using holographic technologies such as Portl.“We think this is going to be a very important role for museums that want to display digital sculptures and things like that,” Wainstein said.The artistsThe OceanDrop NFT auction includes contributions from 21 artists, a mix of established and up-and-coming names.Included in that mix is Nicole Buffett, the estranged granddaughter of investing guru Warren Buffett. She had previously been working with Open Earth and also explored hologram versions of a dolphin-themed piece leading to the OceanDrop NFT.One of Nicole Buffett's pieces. (Nicole Buffett)Buffett has been working with NFTs for a little over a year now and has four collections on OpenSea, all of which have sold out.“With all my NFT sales I like to support charitable causes with a portion of the proceeds going to different funds and different causes,” Buffett said in an interview. “I think there’s a lot of capacity, given the abundance of money generated in the space, to really be bringing in that culture of charity.”Story continuesSomething Nicole Buffett gets asked about often is how her enthusiasm for crypto technology contrasts sharply with the views of her grandfather, who famously called bitcoin “rat poison squared.”“I just think [crypto] is another language, it’s another financial language, and he’s not interested in learning it,” Buffet said. “But I love it. I’m not really that into traditional Wall Street portfolio, stock market stuff. So probably the way he feels about crypto is probably the way I feel about traditional finance.”‘Polarizing’Academy Award–winning digital artist Kevin Mack is making his first foray into NFTs with OceanDrop. His piece is called “Nammu: Ancient Elder From The Distant Future.”Mack says that while his work is fundamentally abstract, it’s heavily influenced by undersea life and reflects his growing up scuba diving in Santa Catalina, an island off the coast of Southern California.Kevin Mack's ocean-inspired piece. (Kevin Mack)The 30-year veteran of immersive art and computer graphics says he’s been “skirting around” NFTs for a long time now because the concept is “so polarizing for a lot of people.”“There’s really a lot of strong advocates of the NFT thing and decentralized currency in general. And then there are people who think it’s actually not a good thing,” Mack told CoinDesk. “I think the biggest argument against it is this notion of imposing artificial scarcity on a thing that is infinitely reproducible without loss. So, I think there’s still a little ambivalence about it. But if they can raise money to help the ocean, then yeah, I was willing to participate.”Ocean to oceanCanada-based digital artist Will Selviz was born in Venezuela, grew up in Kuwait, and now faces the Pacific Ocean in Vancouver. The piece Selviz has donated is an animation called “Sin Agua No Hay Tiempo” (“Without Water There Is No Time”).“I feel like my whole life I’ve moved from one sea to another, from one ocean to another,” Selviz told CoinDesk. “I don’t want to call it a duty or a job, but I’ve tried to help take care of those places wherever I’ve lived, and have taken part in beach cleanups and whatnot.”Selviz, who did his first NFT drop about a month ago at NYC.NFT, is also the founder of the RENDRD Foundation (not to be confused with RNDR, the token), whose main goal is to provide access to underrepresented communities, such as Black youth, within the digital animation industry.“All these things got me down this rabbit hole of figuring out how to fundraise and build a community through NFTs and crypto,” Selviz said.(Will Selviz)HumbledFor the Open Earth Foundation’s Wainstein, the CarbonDrop NFT sale back in March was life-changing. As a result, Open Earth established both crypto and traditional endowments to maintain climate accounting research for the next nine years, said Wainstein.“At the beginning of the year, I wouldn’t have been comfortable launching parallel programs,” Wainstein said. “But because of the CarbonDrop, we’ve established a structure as an NGO that enables us to scale.”Asked if he expects to raise as much as the CarbonDrop sale, Wainstein says he likes to be humble when it comes to fundraising targets.“Our target for success is $250,000,” Wainstein said. “It’s about what’s the minimum amount that we need to launch a program that will make a dent in the sector. And that’s roughly what we think is the minimum to launch a program, to hire a team of oceanographers and blockchain experts to work together.”","December 1, 2021, 2:44 PM"

The index is at the lowest level since late-September, which preceded a BTC price bounce. Additionally, technical indicators are starting to rise from oversold levels as price pullbacks remain limited.“Here we see a classic market pattern: consolidation at an important level in September, a breakout and subsequent steady and methodical buying throughout October and the first half of November, and finally a period of correction and cooling off in November while maintaining significant levels,” Alex Kuptsikevich, an analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.“Now, the correction and consolidation look complete, and the ether looks set to rewrite historical highs,” Kuptsikevich wrote.Latest PricesBitcoin (BTC): $56,799, -1.0%Ether (ETH): $4,568.9, -1.5%S&P 500: -1.2%Gold: $1,779, +0.2%10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.421%November pullbacksLitecoin (LTC) and ether (ETH) outperformed the CoinDesk 20, which includes some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

Arcane Research noted that Decentraland’s MANA token was up about 70% over the past month, which contributed to the overall price rise in tokens with smaller market capitalizations.“We see that seven of the top 10 coins by market capitalization [generated] a negative weekly change in market share, meaning that the smaller coins are catching up [to large-cap coins],” Arcane Research wrote.Additionally, layer one (L1) tokens are on the rise following the Ethereum blockchain network upgrade in early August. “High gas fees on the ETH chain have become a norm now,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.Story continues“This has forced participants to move to other L1 chains that provide cheaper & faster transactions over CeFi (centralized finance) and DeFi (decentralized finance) platforms. We expect this trend to continue going forward into the next quarter as well,” Balani wrote.Strong December for bitcoin?The chart below shows average returns for bitcoin by month.

308,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tim-draper-bitcoin-collapse-fiat-195633304.html,Tim Draper on Bitcoin and the Collapse of Fiat,"Timothy Draper, the billionaire venture capitalist and early advocate for bitcoin, thinks crypto is ushering in a new age of peace. And the future of the world economy is irrefutably linked to blockchain-based technology, he said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Tuesday.“I actually believe that we are moving toward a decentralized world. We’re moving toward a world that is more open and global,” the founder and managing director of Draper Associates said in a live interview. “It’s going to be awesome.”This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.The rise of borderless currencies like bitcoin, which are open technological standards that anyone can use, will create jobs and improve living standards for a great number of people, Draper said. It also sets the stage for a world where centralized governments are irrelevant.“The fact that [bitcoin] is so frictionless means that the entire world will become wealthier because, as we all know, the more friction in our currency, the less wealth in a society,” he said.What Draper calls “frictionless” sounds a lot like an accelerant to the neoliberal reforms of the past 50-odd years. Neoliberalism is a political philosophy born out of the ideas of economists including Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek, who advocated for the deregulation and globalization of markets.Discussing trade wars and stringent immigration policies, Draper said the U.S. empire was voicing the “last roar of the dying lion,” and was making a final claim to “relevance” on the world stage. “The rest of the world is saying, ‘Hey, look, we got global trade. We’re gonna go wherever we feel that there’s enough freedom and trust.’”Crypto may be inevitable, but the innovation doesn’t necessarily have to occur within U.S. borders. To that end, the billionaire scion advocates for a light-touch regulatory approach to the industry. He draws a comparison to the early internet: If the web was regulated at its start, “we would have lost all that economic value [and] all those jobs.”Story continues“All these governments ... want to keep everything under control, then they regulate, but then they lose all their entrepreneurs,” he said. “They do it at their own peril.”Also part of Future of Money Week:The Transhumanist Case for Crypto – Daniel KuhnShiba Inu: Memes Are the Future of Money - David Z.

He also twice won U.S. Marshals auctions of confiscated bitcoin, which he used in part to invest in the industry. His for-profit college for entrepreneurs, the Draper University of Heroes, has long accepted bitcoin payments.Draper says he first intuited the geopolitical significance of bitcoin after the collapse of Mt. Gox in 2013, the largest cryptocurrency exchange at the time. He lost money but gained respect in the market failure. Now, he expects all other currencies but bitcoin to collapse.“These governments are trained to print more money to be more relevant. Well we all know that as soon as I can buy my food, clothing and shelter in bitcoin, I’m not going to want to hold – and neither will anyone else – any cryptocurrency or currency that’s tied to any fiat political force,” he said.","December 1, 2021, 11:56 AM"

310,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-still-track-higher-prices-185328375.html,Ethereum: Still on Track for Higher Prices,"Two weeks ago, see here; using the Elliott Wave Principle (EWP), I was looking for Ethereum (ETH)“to bottom around $3800+/-200 before staging its next rally.”The cryptocurrency bottomed on Black Friday, November 26th, and has since staged the best rally since its all-time high (ATH) was made earlier in the month with, so far, five consecutive up days. Thus it appears a critical bottom was struck, and the weekly chart below shows an alternate EWP-count to the one I showed in my several previous updates, but still equally Bullish.Figure 1. ETH weekly chart with EWP count and technical indicators.As long as Black Friday’s low of $3925 holds, Ethereum can target $5500-6400.The weekly chart reduces the noise of all the daily upside and downs. By simply assessing down weeks as corrective waves within a more significant uptrend, it appears ETH completed (green) minor waves 1, 2, 3, and 4 of (red) intermediate wave-iii, which in turn is part of the large (black) major-5 of (blue) Primary III. As I always tell my premium crypto trading members, in my daily video updates“The beauty of the EWP is that we know with certainty after wave three come waves four and five. Thus as long as the wave four pullback does not infringe in the wave one high, we must anticipate another wave five higher.”Thus, if Black Friday’s low of $3925 holds the tentative but preferred (green) minor wave-4 low, then Ethereum can target $5500-6400. That price target zone is the next Fibonacci-extension zone for (green) minor wave five and typical for a 3rd wave, i.e., (red) intermediate wave-iii. It is unknown where this wave-iii will top at this stage, but once this next leg higher gets going in earnest, I can narrow it down. Also, here the “after three come four and five” pattern applies. Namely, when (red) intermediate wave-iii tops, we must expect wave-iv and v.From a technical perspective, there are negative divergences on the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI5), MACD histogram, and Money Flow Indicator (MFI14), dotted red arrows, but not on the actual MACD line. Thus, the former two suggested the more significant wave-iv correction is looming when wave-5 of wave-iii completes, whereas the latter allows for that wave-5.Story continuesBesides, the price of Ethereum is still well above its rising 10-w simple moving average (SMA), as well as the 20-w, 50w, and 200-w. Thus the trend is 100% bullish on the weekly chart. Last but not least, ETH is also well above the rising (green) Ichimoku cloud, which also signals a 100% bull trend.Bottom line: The “anticipate ETH to bottom around $3800+/-200 before staging its next rally” perspective was correct as ETH bottomed at $3925 last week and has since rallied to within spitting distance of the recent ATH. Thus, as long as that low holds, ETH can stage another impulse (5-waves rally) to ideally the $5500-6400 target zone before the subsequent multi-week correction unfolds. Once that impulse rally is confirmed, I can narrow down the target zone more as there’s currently too little price data available. Meanwhile, the weekly chart shows us ETH is still in a 100% Bullish uptrend and as such, a bullish perspective is preferred.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Natural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Continue to PlungeSilver Price Prediction – Prices Fall Following Moving Average CrossoverE-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Technical Analysis – Sustained Move Under 34214 is BearishCardano (ADA) Targets $1.75 Only if This Indicator Meets a ConditionUAE to Issue NFT Stamp to Commemorate National HolidayHashed Launches $200 Million Blockchain-Related Venture Fund","December 1, 2021, 10:53 AM"

313,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/money-everything-future-where-every-182129990.html,Money for Everything: A Future Where Every Inch of Culture Is Monetized,"One of the things cryptocurrencies do extremely well – for better or worse – is ascribe monetary value to things we didn’t previously understand as being “worth money.”NFTs (non-fungible tokens), it’s often said, are a way of assigning property rights to media files. Before NFTs, if you downloaded an album as a set of MP3s and sent them to a friend, your friend would have the exact same copy of the album. Not so in the NFT era, where there’s only one real copy of the album: the token, verified on a blockchain. The music would still be available to share (at least in theory), but only a lucky few will actually hold the token.It’s a new paradigm for ownership on the internet – one that’s already generated a huge amount of money for crypto companies and early adopters. But it also only works if people start to accept that provenance on the blockchain (i.e., the transparent chain of ownership you can scroll through on “block explorer” websites) actually amounts to property rights. That’s not exactly clear-cut because tokens aren’t legal contracts. They offer no intellectual property (IP) ownership or rights.This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.In the crypto community, it’s a no-brainer that this digital paper trail amounts to a new form of “real” ownership. But if we accept that idea, we accept that the logic of digital markets will come to infiltrate the way we already live our lives online. Using the so-called “platform internet” isn’t always an investment, in an explicit monetary sense. Crypto can turn some of those passive efforts – scrolling, exploring, socializing – into financial transactions. What would it mean to live in a world where every single image, song, health record, Twitter “like” and blog post has a discrete token attached?“Everyone’s already a creator,” said Li Jin, the founder of Atelier Ventures and an ex-partner at Andreessen Horowitz. “We’re all creating content on the internet. I think this binary divide between who’s a creator versus who’s a consumer – it doesn’t really exist. Everyone is creating something of value on the internet.”Story continuesFor Jin, that includes the users who write comments and share posts, along with the people who actually make content. Everyone interacting with this online social mesh is already playing a role in creating value, whether they realize it or not; crypto just affixes a dollar sign to existing behaviors. Things don’t “go viral” without a massive network of individual interactions. In a tokenized future, an early “like” on a post that eventually becomes popular could be a kind of historical artifact; trading it on the secondary market might prove lucrative. Same goes for a highly rated comment, in a comment section.“I think crypto has this ability to blur the lines between who’s a creator versus who’s not a creator because it enables all that value to be rewarded and measured,” Jin explained.Right now, the expectation is that consumers will put time and energy into social media platforms for free, simply because it’s fun. Influencers can leverage followers for corporate sponsorships, and celebrities can use social media as ad space (people are definitely making money on platforms like Instagram) but the fundamental experience of scrolling and interacting isn’t always “rewarded” in the same way. Ironically, there’s an almost Marxist twist to Jin’s thinking: consumers create value for platforms, but don’t always get something in return.Read more: The Future of Money: 20 PredictionsThe other side of that idea – that everyone’s a creator – is that everyone’s also an investor. Time and energy are investments, even if they’re not always monetized. With an explicit financial layer in the form of tokens, users get a material stake in the platforms they use the most.The recent ENS airdrop is a good example of how this could work, if more companies come to adopt these ideas. ENS is the Ethereum Name Service, a company that offers customizable replacements for unwieldy crypto addresses. Rather than typing out all 64 characters every time you want to interact with someone’s wallet, you can just use something like “vitalik.eth.” They cost about $150, including gas fees. But anyone who bought one before Oct. 31 of this year was also entitled to claim a certain number of $ENS tokens, which have proven valuable on the secondary market. Even buying a single domain could have netted you tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of $ENS tokens when the airdrop hit in early November.To some users, it felt like getting free money. But it could also be thought of as a form of compensation for believing in a project early on – an investment of time and energy that was eventually sublimated into tokens. Everything you do “on chain” can be framed as an investment with the possibility of direct monetary rewards down the line. In a fully tokenized future, everyone is a venture capitalist.“We’re all people who exist in a capitalist society,” said Jin. “On the internet, all the actions that we’re taking on all these platforms are already financialized – our likes have value, our retweets have value, the content that we put out there has value. But today, that value does not accrue to the individual user. Tokenizing our work and our actions allows that value to accrue back to the individual creators.”Axie Infinity, a program that bills itself as a kind of crypto-backed video game, has pushed this idea to an extreme. To start playing, you first need to buy three Axie NFTs on the secondary market; right now, the cheapest ones are going for about $100, not including fees. Players can then farm and sell in-game items to make real-world money. In its current form, it more closely resembles a gamified investment platform or slot machine than a traditional online game.“Traditionally, gamers are used to dealing with systems where people are chasing power, respect and a sense of belonging,” said Jeff Zirlin, a co-founder of Axie Infinity. “These are forms of currencies and value, too. All we’ve done is we’ve added real value into the mix.”The problem is that when everything becomes money, it can be hard to think about anything else. Across the world, but especially in the Philippines, people have turned Axie Infinity into a full-time job. Getting paid to play video games isn’t exactly a novelty; streamers and Gen Z media collectives have already found ways to monetize gaming through Twitch, YouTube and other platforms. But what happens to the experience of playing the game, when there’s a real ante up front? At what point does fun become work?“Just where people could not have imagined, like, driving Uber or being an Airbnb host, this is the creation of a new type of work,” said Zirlin.Also part of Future of Money Week:The Future of Money: A History - Dan JeffriesWho Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z. MorrisThe World Bitcoin Will Build - Cory KlippstenWith investment from Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Cuban, Axie Infinity is the most successful example of a “play-to-earn” model that’s become increasingly popular over the past few years. And while blue-chip VC backing is far from a surefire path to world domination, the success of play-to-earn portends a future where fun and finance are increasingly intermingled.“All we’ve done is we’ve added a system of property rights into games,” Zirlin explained. “So, in some ways, we’ve freed people. We’ve given them something that they should have had all along.”Of course, Zirlin and his team didn’t just build Axie for fun; the house can still win when players lose. Axie Infinity doesn’t guarantee anyone money. And it’s not as if Uber drivers – to borrow Zirlin’s analog – are any more economically liberated than other gig workers.In Venezuela, players who can’t afford the buy-in turn to community-driven Axie “scholarships,” which are really more like unbacked NFT loans. There’s a nascent cottage industry of Axie loan operations looking for “scholars” on Discord and Telegram. Axie Revolution, a “scholarship” program with around 40,000 Twitter followers, says it fronts the buy-in in exchange for 35% of future earnings, but most popular programs take much more.

And some creators and artists remain vehemently opposed to participating in crypto at all, for exactly this reason – the idea that crypto only replicates existing systems.“I think that the financialization around the NFT space needs some heavy auditing before it’s an actually fair market for the artists themselves, and that the art is being purchased for the merit of what it expresses rather than what profit it could yield in the future,” the musician Zola Jesus told Pitchfork. “I don’t want people to bet on me like a racehorse.”To that, crypto believers would probably say that capitalism’s relentless churn is already betting on us all.“Individual creators have the option of either tokenizing their work or not – if people feel uncomfortable with that, they can continue carrying on with their current behaviors,” Jin said. “But even though it’s not explicit today, there is already this implicit financialization of your work.”(Kevin Ross/CoinDesk)","December 1, 2021, 10:21 AM"

Polygon aims to solve the scalability issues on the Ethereum network, which has suffered from congestion and high fees.The new listings for the 21Shares ETP, which the company says is Europe’s first product linked to the MATIC performance, comes after it was unveiled on the SIX Swiss Exchange last month.At press time, Polygon’s native token, MATIC, was trading around $2.05. It’s still well off the all-time high of $3 reached in May, based on prices reported by the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.Ethereum Gas FeesMore than 3,000 apps are now on Polygon, according to a report from blockchain development platform Alchemy.“I’m very bullish because of the sheer number of NFT and gaming projects built on Polygon,” said Alexandre Lores, analyst at Quantum Economics.In July, Polygon launched a $100 million fund for projects aimed at combining blockchain technology with gaming.“This made Polygon a step ahead of the rest of crypto in gaming,” said Lores.Due to high fees on Ethereum – also known as gas – it doesn’t make sense to build a video game on the blockchain, Lores said.Lucas Outumuro, head of research at blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock, said that the 21Shares ETP listing might bring more inflows to Polygon. However, he noted, “it’s more likely that the market is repricing layer 2s as we saw with Immutable X (IMX) in the past few weeks.”Dennis Hui, a DeFi portfolio manager at DAO Ventures, said that the price pop for MATIC might just be a reflection of a bull market in cryptocurrencies.“This is a bull market, a bull market that is looking for an excuse to rally, and that’s all there is to it,” Hui said. ”A week ago, we were in love with metaverses. A quarter ago it was layer 1s.” Layer 1 refers to primary blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Polkadot and Avalanche.Also up on the day are Terra’s LUNA, which has increased 10%, trading around $63.50 at press time.

She then sent them back to continue deliberating. A mistrial could be declared if they continue to insist they cannot agree on a verdict.In the hallway of the courthouse, defense attorney Andres Rivero said, “It isn’t over ‘til it’s over.”Defense attorney Jorge A.

316,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shiba-inu-memes-future-money-171404107.html,Shiba Inu: Memes Are the Future of Money,"The shiba inu (SHIB) coin has had a really interesting week. Between late October and Nov. 28, the “Dogecoin Killer” meme token lost about half of its value in dollar terms. Then it surged more than 30% as the Kraken exchange announced it would list the token. Then, starting early this morning, it crashed again by about 20%.Volatility has been a notorious feature of most cryptocurrencies, of course – they’re speculative investments so they swing on sentiment, much like Tesla and GameStop and Rivian stock. SHIB is distinct in that it’s explicitly a “meme token”: It declares pretty much up front that it has no unique utility and depends on attracting a “community” of holders for its value. I don’t think it would be unfair to describe SHIB as a “decentralized Ponzi scheme.”This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here. See CoinDesk’s other “Future of Money Week” coverage here.Parts of that also applies to the likes of bitcoin or ether but meme tokens lack the underlying technological advantages of top cryptos – bitcoin’s hardness, ether’s use in smart contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain – or even the innovation in so-called altcoins like Decred’s governance experiments over the years. Shiba inu’s spiritual forebear, dogecoin, was in fact created to more or less make fun of the idea that crypto was actually an “innovation.” One of its co-creators has become an extremely salty crypto critic.But instead of standing as a performance-art critique, DOGE ended up presaging a wild new species of free-market speculation. It was the first meme token, and during its early days circa 2013-2015 it test-drove the lighthearted community shenanigans that have become an inescapable bizarro element of 21st century capital markets. Just like the GameStop crowd nearly a decade later, DOGE holders organized through message boards like Reddit and engaged in eye-catching stunts such as sponsoring a NASCAR team and the Jamaican bobsledders.Story continuesThe DOGE community is not as prominent these days, but those early memes have helped the currency stay in or near the top ten of all cryptos. As developers put their blood, sweat and tears into technological innovators like Ethereum, and more recently Solana and Avalanche, DOGE just kept derping along, changing barely at all, coasting on Good Vibes.And it worked! Which makes it all the more emotionally complicated to watch something like shiba inu skyrocket in value over the past few months. It is arguably an even purer distillation of the memecoin ethos of uselessness than dogecoin. DOGE at least has its own blockchain, while shiba inu is just an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. It offers no defensible market or technology “moat.” It seems to have benefited substantially from unit bias as new entrants came to crypto and bought the token just because it was “cheap.” Its presence among the most valuable cryptos on some indexes is thanks to a perhaps misleading “market cap” metric. And its supply cap of 4 trillion coins, even if it were reliably enforceable, means there’s very little long-term scarcity.And yet there it is, trading with the big boys. The one thing you can’t do in response is become a meme yourself, gritting your teeth and growling about how “SHIB offers no technological innovation and should be worth zero aaaargh!”By getting mad at SHIB, you’re implicitly buying into the Efficient Markets Theory, or EMT. EMT is (loosely) the “invisible hand” you learned about in your high school economics class, the idea that supply and demand magically converge on a “correct” price. When it comes to assets, EMT assumes that investors, collectively, have access to all relevant information about an asset and reach a price based strictly on that information.But boy oh boy, is that idea deader than a doornail.I’ve recently been digging into a true investing classic, “The Money Game.” Published in 1968, it was in retrospect one of the earliest rebuttals of EMT, après la lettre. It was considered so scandalous, both for its gossip and its principles, that author George Goodman, a working Wall Streeter, felt compelled to publish under the pen name “Adam Smith.” It was a snarky choice, because Goodman set out to undermine, or at least dramatically question, the mechanistic and mathematical worldview that the original Adam Smith developed. And Goodman had some profoundly sage advice that applies to those questioning the rise of SHIB today:“Successful investors I know do not hold to the way it ought to be, they simply go with what is.”Or, translated to modern terms: lol, u mad bro?Now don’t get me wrong here – if an economic slowdown hits at the wrong time, the SHIB Army is going to get routed like Napoleon invading Russia in winter. Even in a minor crypto-market downturn, we saw it sink dramatically. So if the real economy tanks and people decide they need to cash in their SHIB to pay the bills, it’s bye-bye. There is no “buy the dip” or long-term growth flywheel for meme tokens. They’re very much a game of musical chairs; if you’re standing when the music stops, ouch.However, if excitement and community around SHIB remain high long enough, all that logic and reason is out the window. For one thing, in the 21st century, memes have a habit of reshaping reality. Take GameStop, a failing mall retailer that is in the process of leveraging its Reddit popularity to substantially restructure its business. SHIB already has at least a few interesting projects and expansions, such as the Shibaswap “Decentralized Exchange” (I’m using scare quotes because I frankly have no idea if it’s a real DEX).And here’s where we circle back around to the volatility of crypto as a whole. Bitcoin was itself for a long time just as volatile as SHIB. It still is sometimes! Good, solid ideas are memes too, after all, and they take time to spread and suffer setbacks. Volatility in speculative assets is one index of how a new idea spreads through markets. Or, in the case of SHIB, a new joke. In the medium term, there’s maybe not much difference.This dynamic isn’t particularly a good thing, but its root cause isn’t meme tokens, it’s the broader overheated asset market, which is a function, at least in part, of the slam-bang U.S. economic recovery. The implicit long leverage in the valuations of companies like Tesla – which is in the S&P 500! – would melt under the hot lights of a genuine downturn, probably not much more slowly than SHIB. There is still a serious difference between speculative bets like GameStop and SHIB and more established assets with clear theses, like Ethereum or Pfizer.But we live in a world where that line is more permeable than ever. Dreams and memes can evaporate in a light breeze, but given enough time and enthusiasm they can also become reality. And if it’s a crypto, the Real Thing that a meme becomes is simple: It becomes money.","December 1, 2021, 9:14 AM"

320,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stablecoins-tenuous-relationships-banks-155038039.html,Stablecoins’ Tenuous Relationships With Banks,"As regulators increase their attention on stablecoins, the stage is set for traditional banks to become all the more central to stablecoins’ adoption.Stablecoins have thus far served as an elegant solution for the cryptosphere. They provide a checking account-like asset enabling traders to get in and out of positions without having to go off chain. Bank deposits don’t live on a blockchain – for now – and are thus an ineffective payment medium for this purpose.This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.Yet, no matter the level of financial innovation and all the cryptosphere’s talk of disrupting the traditional financial system, all roads always lead back to the banking system. In stablecoins’ case, it’s with their reserves and their attempts to establish a reputation.As stablecoins’ reserves come under increasing scrutiny, stablecoin issuers have emphasized their deposits in banks. Many – such as Pax dollar and Binance USD – describe how their coins are backed by fiat deposits in “FDIC-insured banks.” Never mind that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. doesn’t insure banks; it insures some deposits, and only up to $250,000 – well below the billions of dollars’ worth of issued USDP and BUSD. Gemini Dollar goes as far as to suggest its holders can get “pass-through” FDIC insurance – that is, per-user FDIC insurance up to $250,000. They can’t. When news broke that Circle’s USD coin had strayed from its claim of being fully backed by dollars “in a bank account,” it quickly announced a shift back to safe assets.Moreover, these banks aren’t typically household names like Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan, but rather are small banks that have taken on a crypto-friendly identity. Several stablecoins bank with Signature Bank, while the Facebook-turned-Meta’s libra-turned-diem has partnered with Silvergate Bank ahead of its rollout.Stablecoins aren’t money market fundsStory continuesThe biggest stablecoins’ banking relationships seem to be the most tenuous. Tether, the stablecoin industry leader, holds about 10% of its reserves in “cash and bank deposits” as of its last reviewed attestation. We know little about these banking relationships other than that they include a large deposit at a shrinking Bahamian bank. We know even less about the industry’s silver standard – USD coin. USDC holds 100% of its reserves in what it calls “cash and cash equivalents.” But that is a black box of bank deposits and “highly liquid” investments that mature in 90 days or less. Regardless, it’s clear these holdings are satisfactory for crypto traders’ use cases.Yet, despite the resemblance of stablecoins’ portfolios to the assets held in the $5 trillion U.S. money market fund (MMF) industry, we shouldn’t necessarily expect stablecoins to perform the same when a crisis comes. MMFs have one thing stablecoins don’t: strong banking relationships.When the Federal Reserve rescued MMFs in 2008 and 2020, it used U.S. banks and their dealers as intermediaries. As it stands, however, no one on Wall Street has really seen these larger stablecoin players. Tether holds upward of $30 billion of commercial paper in its portfolio, but none of the small group of Street commercial paper dealers has seen it (it’s had to source these assets abroad), and it’s struggled to form any meaningful domestic banking relationship.And it’s not clear these banking relationships can be quickly formed, even just for assisting in a crisis. An intermediary bank would typically have to attest that the end borrower met the Fed’s terms for lending – which typically include being solvent, being U.S. domiciled, having pledge-able and eligible collateral and more.Even in the cases of stablecoins that do have U.S. banking relationships, it’s not clear these small banks can quickly perform these functions typically performed by big Street banks. To wit, the Fed’s rescue of MMFs in 2008, in its role as “lender of last resort,” occurred after banks already stepped in on their own.Also part of Future of Money Week:The Downside of Programmable Money - Marc HochsteinThe World Bitcoin Will Build - Cory KlippstenThe Future of Money: 20 PredictionsLet the Market Come Up With Better Money Tech - Jim DornNot only do MMFs have banking relationships, but many are sponsored by large banks, which have been quick to intervene to support their affiliated funds. Moreover, banks could use the Fed’s rescue programs to support their own sponsored MMFs – which makes for a quick hurdling of the operational obstacles to a rescue. Stablecoins don’t have recourse to a large bank’s balance sheet or access to large bank’s services and on-lending of Fed assistance in crisis.For as much as stablecoins market themselves as a nonbank solution, and for as much as they’ve pushed back on the suggestion of bank-like regulation, they still need banks. Their narrative that innovation can occur only outside of the regulated banking sector lacks explanation or historical support.It therefore stands to reason that stablecoins will likely be subsumed by banks – if not by regulation, then sooner or later by market forces.The opinions expressed herein are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of the Yale Program on Financial Stability.","December 1, 2021, 7:50 AM"

It’s undercutting rival NFT exchanges on fee structure (2% compared to OpenSea’s 2.5%) and subsidizing withdrawal fees in a bid to woo users who may be spooked by sky-high Ethereum gas fees.Another big difference is on the custodial front. Harrison said FTX.US will take custody of listed Ethereum NFTs, which he said will save users money.

Sports clothing maker Nike created ""Nikeland"" - a virtual world on Roblox in late November.The ""metaverse"" refers to a range of online 3D virtual environments, where people can play games, build things, socialize, work and even trade and earn crypto assets. Crypto giant Grayscale said in a report this week it could become a $1 trillion annual revenue opportunity.Indeed, people already spend millions of dollars on it. A plot of land on the Sandbox gaming platform sold for a record $4.3 million this week. This broke the record previously held by Metaverse Group, a subsidiary of Tokens.com, for its $2.43-million purchase of a plot in Decentraland, another virtual platform.Read the original article on Business Insider","December 1, 2021, 5:51 AM"

SOL gained momentum and it might extend gains towards $250.BitcoinIn the past few sessions, bitcoin price faced a strong selling interest near the $58,000 and $58,500 levels. It is slowly moving lower, but there are many important supports, starting with $56,000. The main breakdown support is near $55,500. A daily close below $55,500 may perhaps start a bearish wave towards the $52,000 level.If there is another attempt to clear $58,000, there are chances of a move towards $60,000. A daily close above $60,000 could start a steady increase. In the stated scenario, the price could rise towards the $62,500level.Ether (ETH)Ether outperformed bitcoin and rallied above the $4,650 resistance level. The bulls are now struggling near the $4,800 level. A convincing move above the $4,800 level could open the doors for a new all-time high. The next key barrier is $5,000. Any more gains may possibly lead the price to $5,500.If not, there could be a downside correction towards the $4,620 level. The next key support is near $4,550. A downside break below $4,500 may perhaps start a substantial correction.Solana (SOL)SOL started a fresh increase after it formed a base above the $180 level. There was a strong upward move above the $200 resistance. During the increase, the price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $235 swing high to $181 low.Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $212 on the 4-hours chart. The price settled above the $210 level and the 21 simple moving average (H4).SOL is now facing resistance near the $222 level. It coincides with the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $235 swing high to $181 low. A close above the $222 and $225 levels may perhaps send the price towards the $235 high. The next key resistance is near the $248 and $250 levels.Story continuesIf there is a downside correction, the price might find bids near the $208 level and the 21 simple moving average (H4).ADA, BNB, and DOT priceCardano (ADA) showing positive signs above the $1.55 level. However, the bears are defending the $1.60 level. A proper H4 close above $1.60 might start a decent increase. The next major resistance above $1.60 is $1.70. If there is a downside correction, the price might find support near the $1.52 and $1.50 levels.Binance Coin (BNB) is gaining pace above the $625 level. It is up over 4% and trading above the $640 level. An immediate resistance is $650. The main target for the bulls could be $700 in the next few sessions. If not, the price could drop towards the $620 support.Polkadot (DOT) is slowly moving higher towards the $40 level. If the bulls push the price above $40, there could be a slow and steady wave towards the $50 level. On the downside, the $33.50 level is a decent support.A few trending coins are LUNA, CRO, and UNI. Out of these UNI is up over 8% and it might accelerate higher towards the $23.50 level.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Natural Gas Price Fundamental Daily Forecast – Aggressive Short-Sellers Set on Driving Out Weak SpeculatorsGBP/USD Price Forecast – British Pound Shows Signs of StabilizationStocks Recover From The Blow Dealt By Powell’s CommentsOrganic Soybean Prices Rise as Indian Organic Soybean Meal Imports DropChina Proposes Supervision for NFT and MetaverseAUD/USD Price Forecast – Australian Dollar Trying to Build Base","December 1, 2021, 5:02 AM"

329,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stablecoin-supply-measure-ethereum-adoption-123000551.html,Can Stablecoin Supply Measure Ethereum Adoption?,"Interest in the cryptocurrency markets came roaring back this fall, with bitcoin and ether both breaking their previous all-time highs just weeks ago. However, shortly after the breakout things turned south, and the market took nearly a 25% dip.While many investors and traders were calling for an end to the bull market, the stablecoin printer continued to pump new capital into every corner of crypto. Several billion-dollar funds were announced and institutional investors were taking part, arguably for the first time in the short history of the asset class.(CoinDesk Research)The growth of stablecoin supply is likely correlated to decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL) for two reasons:New capital is adding buy pressure to crypto assets, artificially boosting the dollar measure of TVL;New capital is looking to be deployed throughout DeFi to earn yield on trading fees, lending yield and on-chain derivatives.While it could be argued that new market entrants are coming to extract value from the market and leave, it appears that this must be a fringe case. Since the beginning of 2020, stablecoin supply has been almost “up only,” hinting that users may sell into stablecoins, but they are not leaving the industry.The largest bear-case scenario boils down to the fact that most successful DeFi applications are currently used for further speculating on the future of crypto and not solving any real-world problems. However, promising use cases continue to arise, with prediction markets, gaming, 24/7 forex trading and undercollateralized loans all coming to fruition.Regardless of short-term price action, the adoption of stablecoins and DeFi applications by funds, institutions and individuals is a positive for the industry. Innovation on top of Ethereum will continue to connect DeFi with the outside world, and stablecoin growth should continue to be a strong measure of adoption.Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.Pulse checkThe following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week.

BACKGROUND: The founders of both protocols believe they can create a DeFi powerhouse by combining money markets and a decentralized stablecoin. The integration of the FEI stablecoin into Rari Capital could allow for readily available borrowing liquidity that will help stabilize periods of high demand.DyDx plans to offer gas-free deposits from Ethereum to users of its platform. BACKGROUND: The cost of even a single transaction on Ethereum’s base layer is prohibitively high for many potential DeFi users, and DyDx is attempting at creating an easier path to onboarding new users. The news comes days after Binance decided to add support for withdrawals to Arbitrum.Ethereum privacy application and mixer, Tornado Cash, looks ready to deploy on Arbitrum. BACKGROUND: Tornado Cash allows users to deposit ETH from one address and withdraw from another account, in order to maintain further on-chain privacy. The application is often used by DeFi exploiters or hackers to hide any trail of evidence. The Arbitrum integration will allow further use of the Ethereum roll-up, so users can stay on layer 2 and avoid high transaction costs.Twitter’s CEO and bitcoin enthusiast Jack Dorsey stepped down and was replaced by Parag Agrawal.

The move coincides with combined total value locked (TVL) of the DeFi sector posting a new record high of $277.6B, according to DeFi Llama.ETH/BTC on Coinbase: TradingViewHowever, Ether is still down 52.4% from its June 2017 high of 0.176 BTC. Ether also posted a secondary top at nearly 0.123 BTC when the bull market ended in January 2018.The current bull cycle has seen Ethereum steadily gain 423% over Bitcoin since hitting a local low of 0.016 BTC in early September 2019. Ethereum has recently been range-bound between roughly 0.058 BTC and 0.083 BTC since quickly rallying by 174% during April of this year.Compared to the previous cycle, commentators, including Anthony Sassano, the host of The Daily Gwei, have argued that the Ethereum market exhibits much stronger fundamentals owing EIP-1559’s introduction of a burn mechanism to Ether’s fee market, plus surging on-chain activity from the DeFi and NFT sectors.According to Ultrasound Money, more than 1.076 M Ethereum has been destroyed (worth nearly $5.09B at current prices) since 1559 went live in August, equating to 6.3 Ether burned every minute. However, Ether has been destroyed at a rate of nearly 8.4 ETH per minute over the past 30 days.Selling PressureSurging NFT marketplace OpenSea is the single-largest source of burnt Ethereum, having destroyed nearly 11% of the total burn thus far. Simple ETH transfers are second with roughly 10%, followed by decentralized exchange Uniswap v2 with 9.2%, stablecoin issuer Tether with 5.4%, Uniswap v3 with 3.4%, and popular wallet MetaMask with 2.3%.Ethereum’s forthcoming merge with the Eth2 beacon chain may add more deflationary pressure on the markets through a reduction in new supply issuance. Investors may be accumulating ETH in anticipation of a deflationary Ethereum 2.0. However, not everyone is convinced Ether will see new highs despite prices coming so close to the previous record earlier Wednesday.According to CoinGlass, seven of the 10 largest Ethereum futures contracts by volume have seen strong selling pressure compared to buying over the past 24 hours, suggesting many speculators are covering or hedging their positions. Nine of the 15 largest ETH perpetual contracts have similarly seen stronger selling over the last day.Read the original post on The Defiant.","December 1, 2021, 3:59 AM"

It’s one of the pioneering crypto projects and the second-largest cryptoasset by market capitalization. Furthermore, its blockchain-based platform has allowed developers to build and deploy all sorts of decentralized applications.A concept image of a virtual coin based on the Ethereum logo.Source: Filippo Ronca Cavalcanti / Shutterstock.comJust because it’s established, though, does not mean it’s stable. Despite the fact that ETH trades above $4,600, its price is subject to wild swings. And I’d assert that this volatility acts as a detractor to its long-term prospects, opening the door for its competitors who often have lower fees. More Competitors Pop Up to Challenge EthereumThere are many contenders to Ethereum’s throne. Most recently, Avalanche (CCC:AVAX-USD) has emerged as another in a sea of digital assets chipping away at ETH’s position.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAVAX had a strong November, shooting up more than 90%. Ethereum investors, on the other hand, went on a bumpy ride. When all was said and done, ETH advanced just 8% in November.7 Tech Stocks That Could Rally In DecemberI won’t go into depth about Avalanche. It has been identified as showing potential in non-fungible tokens (NFTs), DeFi and more environmentally sustainable transactions. Those factors make it a viable contender to Ethereum. However, it’s Ethereum’s high transaction fees that have many looking for alternatives. Major Crypto Investor Threatens to Jump ShipEthereum’s high gas fees have been getting it the wrong type of media attention lately. Those fees are part of the reason one high-profile investor recently said he was abandoning Ethereum. Three Arrows Capital is a venture capital fund with a significant presence in the cryptocurrency space. It’s run by CEO and crypto billionaire Zhu Su, who earlier this month tweeted that he had “abandoned Ethereum despite supporting it in the past,” based on its transaction fees. The fees, he colorfully argued, were so high they kept newcomers out. Story continuesHe added, “Ethereum culture suffers massively from the Founders Dilemma. Everyone is already far too rich to remember what they originally set out to do.”A few hours later, Zhu backtracked a bit, saying, “I love Ethereum and what it stands for.”Regardless of the fact that Zhu softened his position, the issue of high gas fees is likely to continue to be a problem for Ethereum. And Three Arrows Capital is a big backer of competitor Avalanche.The Bottom Line on EthereumA major upgrade to the Ethereum network went live in early August. Among the changes was the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559. In addition to requiring that part of every transaction fee be removed from circulation, creating deflationary pressure, it also changed the way transaction fees are estimated.While the goal of the upgrade was to reduce gas fees, this chart indicates that has not been the case. As long as transaction fees remain sky-high, making it prohibitively expensive for new users, Ethereum will continue to face criticism. Those critics could easily turn to one of Ethereum’s many competitors, such as newcomer Avalanche. It’s that simple.

Dorsey remains the CEO of the payments company Square.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The consensus is that the move away from Twitter will allow Dorsey to focus more on his passion for bitcoin and decentralization.“If I were not at Square or Twitter, I’d be working on bitcoin,” Dorsey said at Bitcoin 2021, a conference held in Miami in June, according to media reports.In July, Dorsey said Square would launch a platform for developers to create “decentralized finance” projects built on bitcoin. At Twitter, Dorsey spearheaded Bluesky – a project aimed at turning the social media company into a decentralized protocol. According to Platformer’s Casey Newton, Twitter’s new CEO, Parag Agarwal, has been among executives most focused on cryptocurrencies and central to chasing Dorsey’s dreams.Co-founded in the Princeton computer science department by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea in 2013, Stacks Network is a layer 1 virtual network facilitating smart contracts that settle on the Bitcoin blockchain. The STX token acts as a fuel powering smart contracts on the network.While bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, its blockchain was not developed to facilitate smart contracts, unlike Ethereum. Thus, Stacks Network brings added value by enabling smart contracts on Bitcoin’s blockchain with programming language Clarity.Among other factors, the impending Stacks improvement proposal SIP-012 upgrade to boost scalability and the planned release of the CrashPunks non-fungible tokens collection on Stacks on Dec. 12 may be powering the STX token higher.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.According to the official blog, the SIP-012 upgrade could boost the network capacity by as much as 10-fold.“Given the number of launches and the ongoing growth of the network, this would be a significant win for many Stacks builders,” Stacks Foundation’s Mitchell Cuevas noted. “Stacks core developers have bundled these possible adjustments into SIP-012.”While STX has decoupled from bitcoin, its bullish momentum may slow if the larger cryptocurrency faces selling pressure. Bitcoin was last trading unchanged on the week near $57,000.Bitcoin’s immediate prospects depend on investors’ expectations for the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy tightening. According to Bloomberg, money markets are back to pricing faster unwinding of stimulus in 2022 in the wake of Fed Chairman Powell’s hawkish lean on Tuesday.Markets had pushed back Fed rate hike expectations on Monday, pricing a 25 basis point hike in September 2022 versus July 2022 last month.A faster unwinding of stimulus, if any, may weigh over asset prices, including bitcoin, which is still seen as a risk asset.“Bitcoin’s correlation with S&P 500 increased amid the general market sell-off, strengthening our hypothesis that more sophisticated investors are currently not looking at bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, but as a risk-on asset,” Arcane Research said in a weekly note published Tuesday.","December 1, 2021, 2:34 AM"

We also saw the 100 pull away from the 200 EMA, delivering further support.Through the 2nd half of the day, a further widening of the 50 from the 100 and 200 EMAs would bring $5,000 levels into play.Key through the early afternoon would be to avoid a fall through the day’s $4,582 pivot.

For what its worth, crypto markets have been having a good week and have broadly continued to push higher since last Friday’s Omicron Covid-19 variant-related risk-off driven decline.The overall crypto market cap on Wednesday morning was back above $2.6T from the weekend’s sub $2.4T lows, marking a more than 12% recovery from recent lows. The market cap of the overall market has been unable to move back above $2.7T, an area that has acted as resistance now going back to mid-November.Ethereum breaks higher, ATHs in sight?In contrast to the broader market’s struggles to break out, ETH on Tuesday surged above a key downtrend that had been capping the price action going back to the November 10th record highs and also managed to push above last week’s near $4600 highs.Those gains came despite a downturn in the market’s broader appetite for risk assets on Tuesday amid concerns about vaccine efficacy versus the Omicron variant and worries about the US Federal Reserve removing monetary stimulus faster than expected in spite of pandemic risks.ETH’s positive momentum has carried through into Wednesday’s session, with the cryptocurrency now closer to $4800, taking its on-the-week gains to north of 10%. At current levels, ETH/USD is only about 2.5% below its record highs, a distance that crypto investors know can be covered in very short order in the highly volatile crypto space.On the four-hour candlesticks, ETH/USD has become overbought. The cryptocurrency’s 14-period Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) was slightly above 74.00 on Wednesday, its highest since the 9th of November, the day before the market’s previous top. An RSI score above 70.00 is typically seen as indicative of conditions having become overbought.In the short term, that could act to deter further buyers from piling in.ETH/USD breaks higher towards ATHs. Source: FXEmpireBut on the daily candlesticks, the RSI score is a much more modest 59.50, implying that there is plenty of room for further gains in the medium-term without conditions becoming overbought. Few crypto investors would be surprised to see Ethereum hit fresh record highs later on Wednesday or at some point later in the week.Story continuesEthereum continues to outperform BitcoinOne notable crypto market development this week has been the surge higher in the ethereum/bitcoin ratio. ETH/BTC surged above its previous record high from back in May at 0.08232 to move above 0.083 for the first time. In other words, the value of one ethereum has now surpassed 8.3% of one bitcoin.Wednesday’s move higher in the ratio takes ETH/BTC’s gains on the week to above 10%, after the crypto pair began the week closer to 0.075. The recent move high marks a breakout from a pennant that had constrained the price action between 0.055-0.080ish parameters for most of the last three and a half months.ETH/BTC breaks out to fresh record highs above 0.083. Source: TradingViewAs of Wednesday, ethereum’s market capitalisation was slightly more than $560B, slightly more than half of bitcoin’s $1.08T. But ethereum has seen stunning catch up to its older peer bitcoin in 2021, with gains on the year of more than 500% versus less than 100% for bitcoin.According to crypto analyst CEO and co-founder of crypto platform FRNT Financial Inc Stephane Ouellette, who spoke to Bloomberg on Tuesday, “the current BTC trading window seems to associate the asset more with global currency trends, inflation hedges, etc… while ETH has, at least from a current market perception standpoint, higher correlations with the growth of crypto sub-sectors.”These growth subsectors include DeFi, non-fungible tokens and the so-called metaverse, he added.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:USD/CAD: Loonie Strengthens as Crude Oil Prices Bounce Back Ahead of OPEC MeetingDaily Gold News: Wednesday, Dec. 1 – Gold Keeps Trading Below $1,800Bitcoin Price Prediction – A Break Through to $59,500 Needed to Bring $60,000 back into PlayMonoX Losses Over $30 million in WETH and MATICGBP/USD Daily Forecast – U.S. Dollar Pulls Back After Yesterday’s RallyEconomic Data Delivers Mixed Results for the EUR Ahead of U.S Stats and FED Chair Powell Testimony","December 1, 2021, 12:14 AM"
340,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-supports-potential-longs-081154515.html,Bitcoin Supports For Potential Longs,"While the broader trend is still bullish, the recent structure coming off the 69K high is bearish. In these situations I prefer even more confirmation before justifying any new risk. Here is what I’m looking for going into next week.Setup 1:the higher low formation. IF Bitcoin finds support somewhere between the 54 and 56K area, it would be in line to establish a higher low. Usually these formations lead to higher highs which would put price back into the low 60Ks at least. In order to confirm, a bullish reversal candle will have to close in the area, followed by a break of the high. Risk and reward can then be quantified and a new position justified.Setup 2:The double bottom formation. IF Bitcoin tests the 53K low AGAIN followed by a bullish reversal candle. As in the previous setup, this can be in the form of a inside bar, pin bar, outside bar, etc. This location offers a high probability of reversal AND an attractive reward/risk.Keep in mind, that the corrective structure that is in play can also continue to break supports. IF 53,500 is cleared, the 50 to 48K area is likely to follow. While this would be within reason for small time frame bearish strategies, going for a short on the larger time frame is very high risk (you are shorting into high probability bullish reversal areas).Novice traders usually get too caught up on smaller time frame information and miss the broader context. Having a clear set of rules that facilitate more of a market aligned view rather than an ego aligned view helps to avoid these common herd mentality mistakes.If you would like to learn more about the long only swing trade strategy that I utilize for Bitcoin, please visit: https://greenbridgeinvesting.com/pricingThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Private Sector PMIs, U.S Employment, and FED Chair Powell in FocusCrypto Market Today: Bitcoin Struggles, Ether Eyes Fresh High, SOL OutperformsColony Raises $18.5 Million To Support Avalanche ApplicationsShiba Inu Coin – Daily Tech Analysis – December 1st, 2021GBP/USD Daily Forecast – U.S. Dollar Pulls Back After Yesterday’s RallyEconomic Data Delivers Mixed Results for the EUR Ahead of U.S Stats and FED Chair Powell Testimony","December 1, 2021, 12:11 AM"

At this point, Ethereum’s upside momentum is very strong, and it looks that the test of all-time highs is almost inevitable.Other leading cryptocurrencies show mixed dynamics. Bitcoin declined below the support at $57,700 after an unsuccessful attempt to settle above the 50 EMA at $58,300. The nearest support level for Bitcoin is located at $56,000. If Bitcoin gets to the test of this level, other coins may also find themselves under pressure, but it remains to be seen whether such a move will be bearish for Ethereum.Meanwhile, Shiba Inu pulled back below $0.000050 after the recent rally and is trying to settle below the support level at $0.00004450. Dogecoin also lost momentum after an unsuccessful test of the 20 EMA at $0.2265 and is trying to settle below the support level at $0.2150. Solana is currently trying to settle above the resistance at $216 while XRP is testing the resistance at $1.00.Technical AnalysisEthereum managed to settle above the resistance at $4,650 and is trying to settle above the next resistance level at $4,770.In case Ethereum manages to settle above this level, it will move towards the next resistance which is located at all-time highs near $4,865.A successful test of the resistance at $4,865 will push Ethereum towards the psychologically important $5,000 level.On the support side, the previous resistance at $4,650 will serve as the first support level for Ethereum. In case Ethereum declines below this level, it will move towards the support at $4,535. A move below this level will open the way to the test of the support at the 20 EMA at $4,380.Story continuesFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Daily Gold News: Wednesday, Dec. 1 – Gold Keeps Trading Below $1,800Ethereum Is Ready To Test All-Time HighsEconomic Data Delivers Mixed Results for the EUR Ahead of U.S Stats and FED Chair Powell TestimonyCrypto Market Today: Bitcoin Struggles, Ether Eyes Fresh High, SOL OutperformsEUR/USD Daily Forecast – Test Of Support At 1.1325Shiba Inu Coin – Daily Tech Analysis – December 1st, 2021","December 1, 2021, 12:02 AM"

346,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/transhumanist-case-crypto-214250108.html,The Transhumanist Case for Crypto,"If you want to live forever, you need a money fit for purpose. Bitcoin, for many, is the ticket. It’s the first, largest and most decentralized cryptocurrency. It’s widely adopted – from retail investors to pension funds to nation-states. It has a durable brand. There’s a case to be made that it’s the most recent “Lindy” invention, the idea that ancient phenomena are less perishable by virtue of being around the longest.But who would want to live forever? As a historical fact, it turns out, many early adopters of cryptocurrency, that’s who! How fitting! Transhumanists, a broad category of people who want to improve the human condition – extending life or extinguishing death, spreading happiness and eradicating suffering through technology – looked at bitcoin as a powerful tool in their arsenal.This article, part of CoinDesk’s Future of Money Week, is excerpted from The Node newsletter, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.It’s not necessary to name names here, but many of crypto’s earliest advocates had ties to the transhumanist movement. Many influential “crypto natives” still do. There are many flavors of transhumanism: Posthuman, cyborgism, immoralism, biohackers, the singularity are all close cognates. The overriding idea is simply that individual human potential isn’t constrained by our bodies, our biology or even the evolutionary process of natural selection. There’s a pill for that!Nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science – sometimes abbreviated NBIC – are at the frontier of scientific advancement, pushing the limits of what’s physically and mentally possible. One day, we might have brain-computer interfaces, blending artificial and natural intelligence, perfecting our memories and infinitely expanding the scope of our knowledge. We might have pills to induce a state of bliss. Who knows?“The purely technical obstacles to transhumanism I’d say are diminishing,” David Pearce, co-founder of the World Transhumanist Association (WTA), now known as Humanity+, has said. He’s right, to an extent. Using a mix of technologies, human beings are already overcoming their natural limits. Death may be a condition for all living beings now, but maybe not for the creatures we may become – or create.Story continuesAlready, there are several for-profit corporations and nonprofit organizations that freeze human cadavers, of once-living people who hope to rise again in the near future when science has found a solution for disease, depression and death. New York University scholar of digital culture Finn Brunton called these people “extropians,” and chronicled the associations between cryptogenics and crypto.More from Future of Money Week:7 Wild Scenarios for the Future of Money - Jeff WilserThe Downside of Programmable Money - Marc HochsteinEthereum in 2022: What Is Money in the Metaverse? - Edward OosterbaanThe Future of Money: A History - Dan JeffriesWho Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z. MorrisNot able to know the state of the world they’d be born into, the “temporarily” dead need money that could outlast banks and even governments. Many were of a libertarian bent and thought the U.S. dollar was due to collapse. But you don’t need to be a futurist to think bitcoin will persist as long as the internet does. Sufficiently decentralized, bitcoin isn’t a hedge against inflation but societal collapse (in theory).All of this seems like a gamble. But stay with me, and hold the ethical phone.Transhumanism – literally “beyond human” – is as focused on setting artificial limits around the human condition as it is about additive technologies. Pearce, for one, looks to genetics as the realm for creating perfect human subjects. He notes that when he founded the WTA, the human genome wasn’t even decoded. Every year since then we’ve learned more about the basic building blocks of life – and eventually will be able to arrange them how we please. And why wouldn’t we choose perfection?The “morphological freedom” to design babies to have favorable traits – to be smarter, more athletic, more outgoing than their peers – means identifying and dismantling bad genes. It’s literally artificial selection. In a similar way, Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto imposed an arbitrary limit around his monetary creation – 21 million BTC.Some maximalists envision a world where all economic activity flows through the Bitcoin network, which would outcompete other currencies. Bitcoin has some advantages over the fiat system: It’s borderless, censorship-resistant and has settlement finality. It’s only grown in value since being released to the world. And, more importantly, it’s bigger than any government can control.See also: The World Bitcoin Will Build | Cory KlippstenIn both instances of transhumanism and hyperbitcoinization, a tiny elite would rule. Bitcoin scarcity means that not everyone can share equally in the wealth, and its deflationary attributes reward the earliest adopters. Meanwhile, although Pearce and many transhumanists are broadly utilitarian and advocate for whatever would create the happiest humans (sometimes animals) in the future, he’s not a redistributionist.In his book, “The Hedonistic Imperative,” Pearce argues that the world would be better if everyone was more like Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, rich and blessed with good genes. Whatever Gates-like post-human comes next, which we will create using the most transformative technologies, would mean the rest of humanity is obsolete – unable to compete.Not every bitcoiner is a transhumanist, and not every transhumanist is a eugenicist, but it’s worth looking at how the movements relate and speak to each other. One lesson from a decade of crypto innovation isn’t whether something is technologically possible – but whether there is the social and cultural will. What might be most Lindy of all is knowing that technology – always an extension of the self – may always escape our control.","November 30, 2021, 1:42 PM"

LUNA, the native token of the Terra blockchain, rallied about 13% as traders chased incentive programs.Overall, trading conditions were choppy across global markets after the U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that monetary policy could tighten faster than expected – potentially a negative for speculative assets, including cryptocurrencies and equities.Despite short-term price swings, some analysts remain bullish on bitcoin.Latest pricesBitcoin (BTC): $57,622, -1.0%Ether (ETH): $4,661, +5.4%S&P 500: 4,567, -1.9%Gold: $1,775, -0.5%10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.436%“As BTC is looking good to close November below the expected target of $60,000, investors are optimistic that the cryptocurrency will repeat its historic trend of ending the year on a stellar bullish note,” Nikita Rudenia, co-founder of asset management firm 8848 Invest, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. Rudenia has a $70,000 BTC price target by the end of this year.Other analysts pointed to bearish bitcoin options activity as a point of concern. “Puts are getting more expensive as market participants turn their focus towards hedging spot [positions] or speculating on further downside. In a recent tweet, Genesis Volatility themselves noted a large amount of short-term put purchases,” Delphi Digital wrote in a Tuesday blog post.Bitcoin dominance fallsBitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total crypto market capitalization, or dominance ratio, has declined about 10% over the past two months to the lowest level since September. The decline in BTC’s dominance reflects the recent outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).Some analysts view the rotation from bitcoin to altcoins as an indicator of greater appetite for risk among investors.Bitcoin dominance ratio (CoinDesk, TradingView)Ether outperformsEther, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was approaching $4,800, near its all-time high, and was up about 5% over the past 24 hours. BTC was roughly flat over the same period.

Now, the buyer wants everyone to have a free copy.The buyer, Vignesh Sundaresan, who's also known as MetaKovan, told Bloomberg he'd be happy if everyone downloaded a copy of the multi-million dollar non-fungible token, ""Everydays: The First 5,000 Days.""That's because Sundaresan, a crypto investor who cofounded bitcoin ATM company BitAccess, told Bloomberg ""information wants to be free,"" and keeping things on the internet inside walled gardens like paywalls doesn't work well.To him, everyone should be able to enjoy an NFT, a digital piece of art tied to the blockchain, without having to pay for it. For those who pay for the production, they get the credit for it, Bloomberg wrote.""Instead of giving the importance to that copy of the file, it kind of gives importance to something else big. The idea that some person supported an artist at some time and this was the memorabilia,"" he told Bloomberg.NFTs have ballooned to a massive market this year, reaching more than $10 billion in trading volume in the third quarter alone, a more than 700% jump from the prior three months.Even as the mania around them continues, NFT enthusiasts and critics are sparring over the digital asset's actual worth. Enthusiasts say NFTs are the key to unlocking the future internet, known as the metaverse; critics say they're nothing more than a file that can be right clicked and downloaded. One critic even downloaded all of them to make a point.In April, Sundaresan said investing in NFTs is ""even crazier than investing in crypto"" and said the asset class wouldn't hold the hype forever.

349,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/note-brands-crypto-isn-t-205252527.html,Note to Brands: Crypto Isn’t Funny Money. It’s Community,"In a mysterious message over Thanksgiving weekend, the Bored Ape Yacht Club tweeted out an image of a 3D-rendered shadowy Ape, wearing pink sunglasses and a green tracksuit. It was an Adidas track suit to be specific, with a BAYC logo on the left breast.Another popular collection, PunksComic, whose derivative comic series that comes with fractional ownership rights to 16 CryptoPunks and whose initial non-fungible token (NFT) issue sells for over $27,000 at the time of this writing shared a similar image with one of their characters.Sam Ewen, head of CoinDesk Studios, has spent over two decades in the technology, innovation and creativity marketing industry while working with many of the top brands in the world.Another popular NFT collector/creator named GMoney also posted an image with his trademark silhouette wearing a hoodie and a crypto wallet address printed adjacent to the Adidas trefoil icon on the garment. All tweets had the simple text “/// 👀” next to them.This all comes after a busy past few weeks for Adidas and its full-on jump into Web 3 with a land purchase/partnership in metaverse project The Sandbox and also announcing a collaboration with Coinbase with a simple tweet using the Web 3 crypto slang phrase, “Probably nothing.” Brands fail to understand that Web 3 is about community-based ecosystems, not just financial ones. And they are talking directly to the communities and influencers, not their wallets.Read more: Facebook Steals Another Crypto Idea for Its Nonsensical RebrandWhen AMC cinemas announced that it was starting to accept crypto for ticket sales and concessions, with a specific shoutout to dogecoin holders that it is the next crypto on the list, it got some great press and some supportive comments. However, the movie theater chain seems to have done little to build a toolset to support crypto, nor does it seem to be an active participant in being part of the larger crypto conversation. AMC did it for the eyeballs.Story continuesIt is not alone. Burger King offered a rewards contest to win either one of 20 bitcoin, one of 200 ether or 1 of 2 million dogecoin, but you needed a RobinHood account to claim the rewards (a marketing partnership at its purest), and it was not very decentralized. Even when Visa bought CryptoPunk 7610 for about $150,000 in August, it barely did much with it beyond a blog post and changing its public relations Twitter handle’s profile picture for one day to the punk avatar. With the CryptoPunk floor now at over $383,000, it may be one of the few brand moves where a marketing purchase gained value after launch.What AMC, Visa, Burger King and many others (looking at you Arizona Iced Tea, Coca-Cola, Nissan) are missing is that the true value in crypto, and especially Web 3, isn’t in purchasing a funny type of money. It’s about the community itself.Crypto enthusiasts have always wanted to get others into the ecosystem. In 2015, I gave my daughter and nephew paper wallets with $50 in BTC on them for a Christmas gift, less because I wanted them to trade it in for cash but because I wanted them to start to see how the foundational theories around money were changing and that they could be a part of the movement, too. Brands should be looking at participation in the communities as much as they want people to participate and engage with their brands.Whether an owner of a Bored Ape, involved in a DeFi liquidity pool or a contributor to ConstitutionDAO, people want others to “ape-in” to the projects not just because it may pump their holdings, but because they get to spend time with a larger and larger group of like-minded collectors and investors and meet others who are “in the club.”Spend time on Discord channels and users are talking about the project details. But many are also talking about where to vacation, what books to read, cars to check out and which shows they are watching. Just like anyone who has been holding bitcoin, ether or Cardano’s ADA for a few years, when you find your people you talk crypto. But you also talk about life just as much and how this movement is changing us as individuals and as a collective.Read more: The Bored Ape Founders Haven’t Yet Joined the Yacht Club - Jeff WilserWhat mainstream brands are also not understanding is that the creators, influencers and entrepreneurs of the future are hanging out in these communities on Discord, Telegram, Twitter and other emerging Web 3 platforms. The more the brands engage these people now, the easier it will be to know them and work with them on future brand initiatives.A few companies seem to be approaching it the right way.Time Magazine has truly committed to its Web 3 initiative with an active Discord channel of over 8,000 subscribers, art drops with established and emerging artists, Twitter conversations and even a kids animated series based on an NFT artists’ collection. Anheuser-Busch seems to be taking the same route with its Discord server, having almost 5,500 users and a supposed Budweiser NFT drop to come soon.Read more: Planet of the Bored Apes - Will GottsegenIt’s a start, but just a start. These communities are full of smart, driven, generous people and ones that brands should authentically access and connect with now or pay exponentially later.Back in 2016 when I owned a creative marketing agency, if I had told a brand that I could introduce it to a large group of hyperconnected people who are affluent, diverse, world travelers and who want nothing more than to align themselves with each other and the brands that support their ethos, lifestyle and journey with little more than a small financial investment and some spot-on community involvement, they all would have been ready to jump in.Well, here they are and we are.

But while he was touting monthly gains as high as 148%, he was in fact losing money, according to the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.""The burgeoning cryptocurrency market can be attractive to investors; however, investors should be aware of the inherent risks, including the risk of fraud,"" US Attorney Damian Williams said of the case.From November 2017 through April 2019, Spence solicited investors in various crypto funds he had created, including the Coin Signals Alternative Fund and the Coin Signals Long Term Fund. Investors who wished to participate would transfer cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin and ether, to him, and he would invest it on their behalf.But as Spence consistently lost money trading cryptocurrencies, he would raise money from new investors using fake performance data to fund his ongoing scheme. He failed to accurately report his losses and falsified account balances to show they were supposedly making money.Overall, he distributed cryptocurrency worth about $2 million to investors, which substantially came from funds previously deposited by other investors. Spence was originally indicted in January and is the subject of a civil suit brought by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is seeking millions in penalties and restitution of the victim's losses.His guilty plea to commodities fraud carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.

351,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-slides-bull-run-shows-signs-of-wear-as-omicron-fed-taper-loom-185624653.html,"Bitcoin bull run shows signs of wear as crypto investors eye other coins; Omicron, Fed taper loom","The volatile but never boring market for Bitcoin (BTC) has been whipsawed in recent days, as investors ponder whether there are better returns to be had in other cryptocurrencies, even as a new COVID-19 variant and the Federal Reserve's policy outlook shake up the landscape.With news of the Omicron strain of COVID-19 unsettling investors, Bitcoin shed over 2% on Tuesday as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dropped several hints that the central bank is growing more attentive to inflationary risks, and may even accelerate its plans to pull back on stimulative bond purchases.In theory, the rise of a new variant would prompt the Fed to err on the side of more stimulus, which should benefit cryptocurrencies. Still, Bitcoin sold off sharply along with other risk assets last week, and has yet to challenge its record high near $68,000 set earlier this month, off by more than 20% since hitting that peak.To be certain, Bitcoin is still firmly entrenched in bull market territory. However, other crypto assets, some notably smaller and higher-risk, are seeing growing investment flows, and may be drawing money away from Bitcoin holdings.Jon Wolfenbarger, a veteran equities analyst, told Yahoo Finance this week that he's using the 250 day-moving average (DMA) to judge whether crypto and other assets might begin long term turns for the worse. While stocks, bonds and commodities still traded above their 250 DMAs on Friday, Wolfenbarger cautioned that ""there has been enough damage done recently to tell us that we need to be very vigilant for continued weakness that could trip bear market signal,"" even if the larger uptrend remains intact, he said. During the downturn, notable Bitcoin whales like El Salvador, the largest nation state holder of BTC, which is planning to issue sovereign BTC bonds; and MicroStrategy, the largest publicly listed U.S. company, both used the recent correction as a buying opportunity. Story continues'Further down the risk-curve'A recent trend indicates more investors are hunting for crypto trading opportunities outside Bitcoin.Ether (ETH) — a major “Web 3.0” contender integral to the boom in nonfungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance and the Metaverse — has logged gains higher than BTC, roughly doubling its performance over the last week. Meanwhile, higher risk meme-coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE-USD) and Shiba Inu coin (SHIB-USD) are posting even larger gains. The latter is up over 16% on the day, coinciding with its listing today on the U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange, Kraken.At least a few crypto investors consider Bitcoin safe haven asset of sorts, largely because of stimulative government policies that feed inflation and devaluation, but its price action suggests its more closely linked to other risk-sensitive assets. Added to that, data suggests that money is rotating out of Bitcoin into other speculative cryptos. This pattern is best captured in the ether/bitcoin trading pair, which is trading near levels not seen since 2018, according to Trading View. “A break-out of ETH/BTC would further support the thesis of an observable rotation out of BTC and into more speculative alts[coins],"" the asset manager Fundstrat wrote in a research note Monday.Beyond speculation, ETH is also used to pay transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain. Its price action relative to Bitcoin also shows why lesser known cryptocurrencies built on top of Ethereum, especially within DeFi, are seeing the most significant gains over the last few weeks.“When the market is moving and certain sectors are doing well, as they are currently in DeFi assets, then traders add risk and allocate out of the safe haven [bitcoin]” said Bryan Hernandez, President of the DeFi trading app, Structure.And the initial buying in these smaller cryptocurrencies is much more speculative according to Hernandez. “Because smaller DeFi assets tend to be less liquid, they are more affected by moves from powerful players like big VC funds or certain market makers,"" he added. ""The access to credit that these players have gives them an ability to really push the price to new levels that then create awareness and FOMO buying.""Other cryptocurrencies connected to the metaverse via virtual platforms The Sandbox and Decentraland, have seen swings of more than 50% and 25%, respectively, over the last several days.Contrary to a speculative frenzy, the rotation from Bitcoin to smaller cryptocurrencies suggests a degree of market health according to Mark Elenowitz, president and CEO of the fintech firm, Horizon Fintex.“Investors are willing to go further down the risk curve for yet-to-be-built projects (i.e. the metaverse) because, again, they view the overall market structure at the moment as trending green.” said Elenowitz.If the new Omicron-variant does shape buyer demand long term, some investors see a path for Bitcoin to rise in value as an inflation hedge. Yet Craig Erlam, Oanda senior analyst, isn’t so certain. First, it isn't clear yet whether central banks will stall tapering enough to change investment growth, the analyst argues. Secondly, higher levels of inflation might cause the market to react in a markedly different way than they have during the early days of the pandemic.“Everything is hypothetical at this point,” Erlam told Yahoo Finance. “But it's always too convenient to try to pin [Bitcoin] down to one narrative.”David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

These are not. To open our minds as to what the future might bring, we chucked the usual concepts like “most likely” or “bet on this.” Instead we wondered, what are some dark horse scenarios that maybe, just maybe, could revolutionize the way we think about money?Here the focus is more on fun than functional, more possible than probable. Then again, we now live in a world where cartoon apes sell for $2.6 million, memes about dogs are worth billions, and a sovereign nation accepts bitcoin as legal tender.Anything is in play.This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.1. Risk becomes tokenizedWhat if we could tokenize risk? If we do this in a clever way, we could reduce the overall risk in the system and avoid meltdowns like the financial crisis of 2008, says Ashleigh Schap, a decentralized finance (DeFi) investor and adviser at Uniswap, a decentralized trading platform.Here’s how to think about it. Imagine if you, as an individual, have tokens that represent each of your risks and liabilities. A token for your car loan. A token for your home mortgage. A token for your leveraged margin trading account. If you roll up all of your individual risk tokens, that would give you a sense of your total risk.Now zoom out the lens. Imagine aggregating all of the risk tokens by each person in the community, and then an entire industry, or even the entire economy. Because these tokens are all smart contracts – programmable money – this would let you “build risk into the system in a more fundamental way,” says Schap.She contrasts this to the constraints of traditional finance, most famously in the collapse of 2008, where each company had its own siloed view of risk but they lacked a holistic picture of the overall risk to the system. By tokenizing risk? You can snap all the puzzle pieces together, and “smart contracts can basically assess the entire picture.”Story continuesRead more: The Future of Money: 20 Predictions 2. Cars spend money and buy their own insuranceWay back in February of this year, Elizabeth Stark, head of Lightning Labs, gave me this prediction: “Machines will pay machines, natively, instantly … Teslas will pay for charging with Lightning!”That’s just one example. The possibilities are endless. “Imagine a machine at a factory, if it runs out of ink, it can order more,” says Schap. She then gives a spicier scenario. “Maybe you have a car or a truck that’s able to buy its own insurance,” she says. Perhaps the car has the ability to assess risk and make smart decisions. “If it’s raining, it buys a little more insurance,” says Schap.She notes that in our current world, whenever you buy car insurance, “you’re paying for the insurance every day, even when you’re not driving the car.” You have a busy life. You don’t have time to deal with insurance companies every month, much less every day. But imagine if the car could constantly survey the risks – weather, traffic conditions, even neighborhood – and make constant tweaks to your insurance? (Just before it becomes fully sentient and dominates the world.)3. You will pay for things without thinking about it at allThis could be here sooner than you think. A couple of weeks ago, I went to a Denver Broncos football game. The stadium had a beer stand that looks teleported from the future: First you scan your credit card, then you go through a turnstile to enter a room full of coolers. You take whatever beer you want, then you leave. No scanning of UPC codes. No interacting with any humans. As the attendant explained to me, an elaborate network of cameras and GPS micro-sensors ensures that you are charged for the correct number of beers.Tarun Chitra, CEO and co-founder of Gauntlet and General Partner at Robot Ventures, imagines a shopping experience like this in the future but without credit cards, wallets or even phones. It will be driven by cryptocurrency and stablecoins – not a centralized player like Amazon – and somehow it protects privacy. “You go pick up your items and walk out,” says Chitra. You have an agreement with the grocery store, for example, where “you can automatically charge me if it’s less than $100.”Read more: The Future of Money: A History - Dan Jeffries4. The price of your dinner will be in satsThe idea of “buying a coffee with bitcoin” is now something of a punchline, at least in developed economies like the United States. But it will happen eventually, says Cory Klippsten, founder of Swan Bitcoin (and author of an op-ed for this “Future of Money” series). “The medium of exchange for bitcoin will not take off,” says Klippsten, “until a lot of people hold the majority of their net worth in bitcoin.” His logic? It makes no sense to spend your bitcoin “unless you have nothing else to spend.” And he thinks this scenario is inevitable.“Nobody wants to spend bitcoin. It’s the best risk-to-reward bet in history,” says Klippsten. And yet. As a bit of foreshadowing for what the mainstream world could look like, he points to the precedent of OG bitcoiners who have the majority of their assets in BTC. They got rich off bitcoin. They HODLed their bitcoin. But at some point, inevitably, when push comes to shove, they need to spend at least some of their BTC to do things like buy a car or a yacht.Klippsten predicts that bitcoin as a store of value will become so widespread, and so ubiquitous, that eventually people will need to spend their assets. He imagines a chart with two “S curves”: one for the adoption of bitcoin as a store of value and then one with bitcoin as medium of exchange. (S curve: It starts out gradual and flat, then dramatically shoots up, then goes flat again.) “We’re still on the flat part of the S curve for store of value,” he says, and when that skyrockets, people will then hop over to the medium of exchange S curve. He scribbles out a quick drawing on our call, and literally two hours after we spoke, he formalized the graphic and tweeted the following:This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The upshot of all this? “By 2035, most goods and services in most places in the world will be denominated in Satoshis,” says Klippsten. He clarifies that the dollar and other fiat currencies will still likely exist, which means that you might see multiple prices on items, just like you do at international airports. The implication, of course, is that the price of BTC would soar in value. Klippsten’s guess: “The chance of bitcoin being less than $1 million in nine years is infinitesimally small.”5. Tokens make cash go awayFirst, imagine a world where tokens are ubiquitous. As Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, envisions in CoinDesk’s 20 Predictions, “I believe every company in the world will have a token in its capital structure in the next five-to-ten years.” These tokens are hybrids. They’re part quasi-equity, part loyalty program, and they’ll grow in value if the company becomes more valuable.Then he takes the logic one step further. “We’ll also begin to see the digitization of illiquid real-world assets, like your home equity, your car, and your jewelry, as well as tokens that represent future liabilities like university tuition tokens and health care tokens.”Here’s the kicker. Once every asset becomes digitized and liquid, says Dorman, “You’ll never need to own cash ever again. You’ll be able to stay 100% invested at all times, borrow against your assets as needed, and pay for common goods using your investments since they will be spendable blockchain-based assets. By bridging the gap between investment vehicle and payment vehicle, digital assets will ultimately eliminate the need for an asset that functions purely as money.”Read more: Who Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z. Morris6. Your house is a bankThis is an offshoot of the “cars can buy insurance” scenario, with a twist. If you’ve been in crypto for more than five minutes, you’ve heard the phrase “be your own bank.” But Chitra wonders, what if your house could be its own bank? Or your car? He notes that in the crypto world, thanks to the magic of liquidity pools in DeFi, “everyone can be a lender if they want to be.”Not only could everyone be a lender but potentially everything. “It could be the IoT [Internet of Things] device, it could be your car, whatever, it could be a building.” In today’s world, using something like a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) to borrow against your building is a manual, tedious, torturous process that involves lots of banking. “That will become almost instant,” says Chitra, “as every building can become its own bank.”And in the true spirit of this exercise, Chitra lobs another thought experiment: “The richest entity of the world becomes a broken Tesla.” The Tesla breaks, it can’t work and it can’t earn fees in the future where it gets paid for being an Uber. In the process, the Tesla somehow realizes that “the only thing it can do with its money is trade.” Because the broken Tesla can’t do anything else, it slowly learns to trade, it excels, it becomes a super trader, and “you have this rags to riches story.”Think that scenario is out there? Buckle up for the final one.7. Money goes intergalactic“Galaxy Brain” doesn’t do this scenario justice. It is literally inter-galaxy brain. Schap clarifies that this scenario is far, far, far out in the future, but thinks that “assuming we continue to develop technologically, and if we manage to become space navigators – and we’re headed in that direction – money will need to change, because time will change.” She then suggests an idea inspired by the sci-fi novel “Neptune’s Brood,” from Charles Stross.If we’re trying to travel to another galaxy that’s 400 light years away, as Schap explains, “money will mean something very different when you get to that very faraway place.” Decades, centuries, or millennia might pass while you make the journey from Earth to another corner of the universe. What if money could somehow incorporate properties that would account for these dramatic changes in time?“I think you’ll have difference classes of money,” says Schap. “You’ll have immediate money that you’ll spend on a planet.” Then there’s “medium-term” money, which would be “useful somewhere in our galaxy.” The final class is what Schap calls long-term “slow money,” which “is much more valuable, but the reason is slow is that it has to move across space and time in an interesting way.”Coming soon, on Coinbase.(Kevin Ross/CoinDesk)","November 30, 2021, 9:53 AM"

357,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inspired-aaron-swartz-ideals-dao-173439095.html,Inspired by Aaron Swartz’ Ideals New DAO Takes Aim at Academic Publishing Industry,"A new decentralized autonomous organization is drawing inspiration from ConstitutionDAO and the ideals of information liberation exemplified by the late activist Aaron Swartz.An early mission statement was shared on the currently nameless DAO’s Discord server during the call: “The vision is to design an incentivized system for open access academic peer-reviewed publishing.” The idea began with a Twitter thread from Nov. 18, in which David McDougall, a vice-president at crypto prime brokerage Genesis Trading and instigator of the DAO suggested, “We could buy all of academic publishing for ~ $25 Billion, but we could start one journal at a time.”Paywalled PublishersThe thread culminated over the last few weeks into an actual effort, and its first team call was kicked off Monday afternoon New York Time by McDougall who explained that he was “really inspired by what happened with ConstitutionDAO. “I watched a bunch of people come together to solve a capital allocation problem to go after a really big goal.”Various early supporters, most of whom were running other efforts aimed at making science more legible, also provided grounding thoughts for this first conversation. “This DAO could end up putting pressure on the big paywalled publishers,” said Patrick Joyce, of the open science community ResearchHub. “If anything comes out of this project it could be huge economic pressure on the powers that already exist to be better actors.”Academic publishing is widely derided as creating too much profit for too few companies with paywalled access for research that’s often produced with public money. Swartz engaged in civil disobedience against the academic press. Facing federal prosecution for allegedly unlawfully downloading academic publications, he took his own life in early 2013. Since then, he has become a hero for many hacktivists and free speech champions who share his ideals, and his efforts would presage other legally grey initiatives that liberated research, such as the website Sci-Hub.Story continuesSwartz’s MemorySo, McDougall initially wanted to actually name the effort after Swartz, calling it “SwartDAO” (the name which still serves as its Twitter handle). Until Monday, the Discord server icon for the group was a line drawing of the late Reddit co-founder.“Aaron to me was inspiring,” McDougall said on the call. “He was really relentless in fighting for things he believed in.”I feel like this is one where I made a decision and I’m owning up to it as a mistake that I made and I would love the community to support a new name. That’s where I’d like to get to.”However many members of tech Twitter who aren’t necessarily enamored with the cryptocurrency industry took umbrage at the invocation of Swartz’s memory in a blockchain initiative. The most notable skeptic is probably Glitch founder Anil Dash, a prominent member of tech twitter and a frequent critic of solutions to public problems that lead with technology (he was charitable about the DAO that inspired SwartzDAO).“It’s really f*****g gross to use Aaron’s name without permission,” Dash tweeted. “And during his life he never once commercially exploited his name or the fact that he was well-known, let alone granting rights of usage to people who never even met him.”Not everyone agreed with the negative takes.The name remains indeterminate at this point, along with many other facets of how the project will work. Will the DAO really try to start acquiring journals or will it just start one of its own, for example? Interested potential participants can weigh in on its nascent FAQ in real time.Votes are closing midday New York time Tuesday on 15 possible names for the new organization.McDougall said, “The name was a way to say we have a goal and it was a big ambitious goal.”Read the original post on The Defiant.","November 30, 2021, 9:34 AM"
358,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/downside-programmable-money-172706055.html,The Downside of Programmable Money,"If smart contracts, the self-executing financial agreements that have drawn hundreds of billions of dollars in investment to blockchain networks, seem magical, then maybe it’s time to rewatch “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice.”In the iconic segment of Disney’s 1940 animated film “Fantasia,” Mickey Mouse plays the titular character who learns a hard lesson about the dangers of automation. To avoid the drudgery of carrying buckets of water down castle stairs to fill a cauldron, Mickey dons his master’s magic hat and animates a broom to do his chore for him. The rodent dozes off, then awakens to find the anthropomorphic broom has been following his instructions all too literally, with disastrous results.This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.Skeptics of the idea of programmable money see similar risks in entrusting financial activities to code.For one thing, hackers have drained some $685 million from various decentralized finance (DeFi) systems over the last 18 months, according to The Block, showing that at a minimum code needs to be thoroughly inspected before deployment.Yet, to Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, software bugs aren’t the half of it.While cryptocurrency was born partly as a rebellion against the bailouts that followed the financial crisis of 2008, Kelly sees the ultimate lesson of that era as the need for the discretion that smart contracts remove.Read more: Who Sets the Rules of Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z. MorrisCoinDesk recently chatted with Kelly about why he thinks programmable money is a boon during normal times, why it could create problems in market calamities and the difficulty of creating “kill switches’' for when things go awry. A lightly edited transcript of that conversation follows.CoinDesk: When you consider the idea of programmable money, contracts that are set out in code rather than executed by humans, what do you see as the potential benefits? And what do you see as the downsides?Story continuesSteven Kelly: It’s sort of my natural inclination to split things into peacetime versus crisis time.In peacetime, this is an unequivocal good. You’re just talking about faster, cheaper payments [and] less discretion, which means less room for human biases, less room for human error. Of course, this introduces all the [risk] of coding errors and protocol vulnerabilities, but since we’re talking about the future of money, we’re kind of assuming that gets worked out. And so you have the potential to streamline things, have payments happen when they’re supposed to happen, as opposed to “after forms get filled out and people press buttons and so-and-so gets back from vacation and remembers to return your call” and things like that.There’s a huge potential in financial markets, as well. For instance, part of the disruption of March 2020 was literally people just going into their home offices where it’s a different phone number, and the trades just weren’t happening as quickly because people literally weren’t answering phones. Those kinds of things can happen in peacetime, too, because somebody’s on vacation or just because legacy systems are slower. [Processes] can be quickened and made more efficient, and you reduce the cost, basically, of the float.But in crisis time, I get nervous. I get nervous about this idea because I’m dubious of the notion that you can pre-program all the exigencies that may occur in a crisis cycle.In my Twitter thread from Sept. 21 on the systemic risk of smart contracts, for instance, some of the pushback [amounted to], “We in crypto, we programmers, we’re thinking about this, and we know that we need central actors, sometimes, in crisis. We can code in certain contingencies when certain things happen in the market, outside of, you know, x range or whatever.”And I just don’t buy that at all. I believe what they’re saying. I don’t believe it’s enough.Read more: The Future of Money: 20 PredictionsThe stock market peak in 2007 was after the failure of the Bear Stearns hedge funds [one of the earliest signs that the U.S. subprime mortgage market was unraveling]. You just can’t program in, “OK, if the market’s doing this, then this is going to happen.” You can, to some degree, but you’re always going to miss the next crisis. You can’t preprogram the exigencies of a crisis.We as a society have decided, when it’s war time we sort of let these failures slide, they sort of have a public good purpose. Like I had mentioned in my thread, banks usually just stop giving you your money back in a crisis. You’d go to get your deposit and they would say, “sorry.” That was not legal. It was never legal. And when this went to court [for example, in 1857, in the case of Livingston v. Bank of New York], the courts basically just said, “Well, if everybody’s doing it, then we’re not going to let one bank be charged for this.” Because basically the courts understood the exigencies of a crisis. And we sort of let illegal things happen for the greater systemic good. And that’s the kind of discretion that is sort of antithetical to smart contracts and programmable money.Read more: The Future of Money: A History - Dan JeffriesYet, if these exigencies aren’t programmed in, and people get their money out, doesn’t that get us through the crisis faster? Wouldn’t it be better to just force us to rip the Band-Aid off?No, that’s just incredibly costly. There are incredible costs to financial crises and bankruptcies and disruptions to the financial system functioning. Because we can say, “This is a bad bank, we want it to go away, we want a good bank to come up in its place.” But in the time between a good bank, with lots of information about customers, failing, and a new bank arising, and re-gathering all that information about those customers and they can then make loans ... that’s incredibly damaging [to have a lapse in lending activity]. So we want to let those banks fail if they’re insolvent, but we don’t want to do that like that [snaps fingers]. If Lehman could have failed over the course of a year, that would have been great. At least in isolation, it would have calmed [the markets].That being said, I think there is some nuance to this. Because another thing that happens in a crisis is that once an institution is stigmatized, or maybe they’re the main focus of the media as an institution that’s going to falter, they start getting collateral calls. Let’s say you’re Bear Stearns and you’re in the news now and your liquidity is in question. If I’m a counterparty to Bear Stearns, nothing has necessarily changed in the market other than I’m hearing this news about Bear Stearns. I’m going to go to Bear Stearns and say, “Hey, you know what? I don’t like your marks. Now I want a little bit more collateral.” And if you’re Bear Stearns and you refuse, well, then the next headline is “BEAR STEARNS CAN’T MAKE COLLATERAL CALL.”And the news story will cite “people familiar with the situation.”Right! [Laughs] So there’s an advantage to smart contracts here. This is the other side of it. Bear can say, “Well, our smart contract’s handling that. Nothing has changed in the market, our [credit default swap] is here, and the collateral is here, so this is what the margin call is, and you can’t refute that.” So there’s this sort of give-and-take, because as soon as a player is weak, markets will say, “Okay, let’s get some collateral from them, because we know they can’t refuse. And let’s stop paying our margin calls on our other trades with them [where] we owe them some collateral, and let’s conserve our collateral. And let’s just start making calls and make sure they can still meet those calls.”Is there any kind of a hybrid model that you could foresee where you would get these benefits in normal times, while mitigating the downsides in times of stress?You know, it’s really hard because, like I said, none of this is formalized. We sort of let illegal things happen. No one is going to formalize, “when [Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome] Powell says it’s okay to do illegal things, you can do illegal things”! So it’s very hard to formalize ex ante. So I just worry that [a crisis involving smart contracts] will unfold too fast, ex post [facto], before we can be ready for it.I don’t want to stifle this innovation either. And I think there are huge benefits to be had. I want the central bank and others to be able to keep up, and these financial institutions. That’s the other thing: It’s not just crisis-fighter discretion. It’s crisis fighters within private institutions. It’s Goldman Sachs who gets to choose to ignore emails and not answer phone calls. And we kind of like that as a society.A lot of the conversation now with programmability has to do with central bank digital currencies (CBDC). Couldn’t presumably a central bank have some kind of a kill switch, so contracts would be automated but there would be a “break the glass” option?This is another thing that comes up even from DeFi folks. They say, “we have some sort of centralization in a crisis. Put in somebody who’s operating a kill switch, and they only get this discretion in a crisis.” But the problem, and this is a little bit of an irony, is that you need some decentralization. Yes, you can give that kill switch to the Fed. But Goldman is never going to go to the Fed and say, “Hey, we really can’t make a margin call today. Can you flip the kill switch on Citigroup for 48 hours and buy us some time?” That’s never going to happen. But if Goldman does it, then we all just kind of look the other way. And, and we say, “oh, you know, the marks were bad.”Even accounting itself can be complicated, because stuff that’s marked to market all the time, it’s been marked to the price it’s trading at, in a crisis, all of a sudden [the banks holding the assets] will say, “You know? We’re not going to mark this to market any more, we’re going to re-evaluate this.” We see huge chunks of assets move from the trading book to the held-to-maturity book, which are accounted for differently. Another thing we see is [assets classified as] Level 1, which is “we take a market price, and that’s how we keep it on our books,” move it into Level 3, which is like mark-to-model. “We decided that the prices aren’t representative and we want to mark [the asset] to our model.”The other thing that happens is the FASB [Financial Accounting Standards Board] comes out and says, “You know what? You guys don’t have to mark it to market so much. Don’t worry about it. If it’s illiquid, we’re going to change our standards. Here’s some new guidance.” And all that gets lost, you know, if it’s all pre-programmed.Like I said, even in a crisis, there are pros and cons to this. Because in a purely programmed world you can’t prey on the weak advantageously as a counterparty, but also the strong can’t further draw a moat around themselves.(Kevin Ross/CoinDesk)","November 30, 2021, 9:27 AM"

""You need the right platforms … that is definitely going to be a big opportunity for this entire ecosystem.""Israel predicted that the metaverse is where ""we're going to start using cryptocurrencies as currencies."" But he said existing digital currencies are likely to prove too volatile for this, and so some types of stablecoins will probably come to dominate.The metaverse is a catch-all term referring to a range of online 3D virtual environments in which people can play games, build things, socialize, work, and even trade and earn crypto assets.Interest in the metaverse has soared after Facebook said in October it would change its name to Meta, to signal its commitment to building out its own platform. Big companies and crypto developers alike are racing to build digital worlds.One popular platform, Decentraland, uses decentralized crypto technology to enable users to buy virtual plots of land, build their own structures, and vote on the governance of the economy.A parcel of real estate on Decentraland recently sold for $2.4 million, as fans turn to digital properties and land as a speculative investment.

That allows metaverses to remain decentralized, rather than under the control of tech companies or payment providers.Yet Israel said many digital currencies are far too volatile to become used widely for transactions. That means metaverse developers are likely to turn to stablecoins, which are pegged to stable counterparts such as the US dollar.The BofA strategist predicted that traditional payments companies will become much more interested in cryptocurrencies, if they become widely used in the metaverse.

The past year, decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT) have taken the stage to show the world the possibilities that can arise from blockchain technology. However, scalability products that can increase performance in response to changes in processing demands are starting to unlock the vast potential Ethereum holds, and its co-creator, Vitalik Buterin, has his eyes set on decentralizing social media, gaming, governance and more.In its infancy, Ethereum has largely become host to marketplaces for trading and lending crypto assets (Uniswap and Aave) and buying or selling digital art (OpenSea). The introduction of second-layer platforms built on top of Ethereum, like Arbitrum and Optimism, and technological solutions like ZK rollups, will drag down transaction fees and open Ethereum to decentralized social media platforms like Reddit.This article is part of Future of Money Week, a series exploring the varied (and sometimes weird) ways value will move in the future.The common theme among all use cases will be the need for users to own and spend Ethereum’s native asset, ether.Ether is the key to unlocking blockspace on the Ethereum network, whether that includes deploying new applications, using existing applications or sending tokens between different wallets. The native asset is to the network what gas is to a car. Post-EIP 1559, blockspace consumers buy and burn the asset to participate in the digital economy. In the near future, ether will also be used to stake and secure the network.Read More: The Evolution of Ethereum’s Monetary PolicyArising from its usefulness as gas, ether has become a unit of account and the most common pairing on decentralized exchanges (DEX).What is money in the metaverse?If Ethereum, alternative base layer protocols (i.e., Solana and Avalanche) and “the metaverse” are ultimately successful, the definition of money will become much broader than its fiat limitation today. We are already seeing protocols raising capital, and investors measuring their portfolios against ether instead of dollars or even stablecoins (tokens pegged to the value of a fiat currency). However, the use of ether as money does not discredit fiat, stablecoins and other stores of value. It is simply a complement – and one that could potentially become a currency of the metaverse.Story continuesRead More: A Crypto Guide to the MetaverseCrypto assets, including ether, are still much more reflexive to demand than stablecoins and dollars, making them a better investment than a currency (for now). However, the larger the Ethereum ecosystem grows, the better the currency ether becomes.Currently, speculators far outweigh actual blockchain users, but a blossoming ecosystem is changing that as ether can be used for DeFi, NFTs, validation, social media and more. In fact, in Coinbase’s Q3 earnings report, the company highlighted that it has seen a major shift toward people actually making use of blockchain technology by taking their tokens off exchanges.The chart below shows how on-chain users have grown alongside new Coinbase accounts, signaling users are genuinely interested in interacting with applications on Ethereum. Cheaper alternatives to the Ethereum mainnet, or live version, have gained even more traction, with Polygon flipping mainnet in active users for a single day early in October. Additionally, Arbitrum has onboarded 275,000 users looking for cheaper blockchain interactions.Coinbase verified users and active on-chain users grow simultaneously. (Coinbase)Tokenization of assets and composability between DeFi applications are just beginning to create open, tradable markets for assets that were once illiquid. Assets that can be traded against each other, used as collateral or sent to any part of the world in an instant, start to behave a lot more like money than property or stores of value.According to Julien Bouteloup, founder of Stake Capital and core developer at decentralized exchange Curve, the Web 3 workforce has shown significant interest in being paid in token equity over stablecoins. While this could be a side effect of the bull market and rising valuations, employees are likely genuinely interested in being an owner of the projects on which they work.What’s next for the value of ether?Play-to-earn gaming has likely just started, and Ronin-based NFT game Axie Infinity is already generating billions of dollars in annualized revenue. Users throughout the world are living off income from the game, with revenue making up a notable piece of the Philippines’ gross domestic product. The connection between gaming and finance is growing closer, highlighting just one aspect of a more digitalized world.Read more from “Future of Money Week”: Who Sets the Rules for Bitcoin as Nation-States and Corps Roll In - David Z MorrisIf today’s trends are carried into tomorrow’s future, the world will be more financialized than ever. It’s too early to tell whether this will be a net positive for humanity, but crypto and DeFi have given a glimpse into the good and bad that come with tokenization.Airdrops and equity distribution (when done correctly) have distributed wealth much more freely and fairly than corporations have done, historically. However, the other side is equally true as scams and exploits show how greed can be magnified through tokenization and the anonymous economy.For good or bad, the definition of money will continue to become murkier as the digital economy grows, just as it did with the creation of credit cards and online payments and the move away from paper money. This fits perfectly with the narrative of the metaverse, where the line between the digital world and real life becomes thinner and thinner.(Kevin Ross/CoinDesk)","November 30, 2021, 8:43 AM"

At press time, LUNA was changing hands at $57.63, up 11% in the past 24 hours, according to data from Messari.LUNA is part of an algorithmic balancing system that helps stablecoins running on the Terra blockchain maintain parity with fiat currencies. One of the major developments from the network’s Columbus-5 upgrade in October is a new design for keeping stablecoins pegged to their fiat value: whenever UST is minted, LUNA with the same amount of value is burned.According to data from Terra Analytics, more than 92 million LUNA tokens have been burned since Columbus-5 went into effect.“LUNA’s price is a function of UST demand,” said Jeremy Ong, vice president of business operations at crypto research firm Delphi Digital. “As UST demand goes up, LUNA’s price also goes up.”LUNA's monthly price chart. (Messari)Not just USTBut Ong said a number of incentive programs from Terra-based decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms are also a factor.Abracadabra.Money, a multi-chain decentralized lending platform, launched a yield-earning product for non-interest-bearing tokens called Degenbox earlier this month. The product first allowed users to deposit UST as collateral in order to receive yields.Another shot in the arm for LUNA’s price may be a so-called lockdrop event from Astroport, a decentralized exchange protocol on Terra, Ong said.Astroport will launch the lockdrop event on Dec. 6, allowing users to lock their LUNA tokens in exchange for a “drop” of the protocol’s own not-live-yet ASTRO tokens, according to the project’s Medium page.“People are trying to get more LUNA for Astroport’s lockdrop,” Ong said.Terra is the fifth-largest smart contract platform by total value locked (TVL) at $11.87 billion, according to data from DeFi Llama. TVL is the total value of the cryptocurrency committed to DeFi protocols that are built on a given blockchain. Ethereum remains the DeFi market leader with $182 billion in TVL, per DeFi Llama.","November 30, 2021, 8:42 AM"

That hard-coded process is contrasted with the human-decided monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, which has ballooned its balance sheet to about $8.7 trillion, more than double where it stood in early 2020.But bitcoin is also seen as a risky asset, so there’s also a view among traders that loose monetary policies encourage investors to make bigger speculative bets. A reversal of these “dovish” policies might prove a tailwind for bitcoin.At a Fed meeting earlier this month, Powell and other officials announced a plan to “taper” their $120 billion of monthly bond purchases – a form of monetary stimulus – by $15 billion a month.The announcement was seen as an acknowledgement that officials needed to move sooner rather than later to tamp down inflation.Story continues6.2% in OctoberSince April Federal Reserve officials have been attributing fast-rising consumer prices to “transitory” factors that ostensibly would dissipate once the economy normalized.But inflation has continued to rise - with the closely-tracked Consumer Price Index climbing 6.2% in October compared with 12 months earlier. That was the highest pace in three decades, and economists were quick to warn that the price increases weren’t likely to reverse anytime soon.In prepared remarks ahead of the Senate hearing, Powell said that “most forecasters, including at the Fed, continue to expect that inflation will move down significantly over the next year as supply and demand imbalances abate.“During the live hearing on Tuesday, Powell acknowledged economists’ recent predictions that the Fed may need to accelerate the tapering of its monthly bond purchases – to keep inflation from overheating. The U.S. central bank’s final monetary-policy meeting of this year is scheduled for Dec. 14-15.“It is appropriate, I think, for us to discuss at our next meeting, which is in a couple of weeks, whether it will be appropriate to wrap up our purchases a few months earlier,” Powell said Tuesday, according to according to Bloomberg News.Bitcoin and omicronIn the prepared remarks, Powell addressed the growing concerns about the recently-emerged omicron variant of the coronavirus.“It is difficult to predict the persistence and effects of supply constraints, but it now appears that factors pushing inflation upward will linger well into next year,” Powell said. “In addition, with the rapid improvement in the labor market, slack is diminishing, and wages are rising at a brisk pace.”The upshot could be mixed for bitcoin: Rising prices could bolster the cryptocurrency’s appeal as an inflation hedge, but a more hawkish monetary policy on the part of the Fed might prove a headwind.","November 30, 2021, 8:35 AM"

367,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kimbal-musk-big-green-dao-160533309.html,Kimbal Musk’s Big Green DAO Is a Big Step for Web 3,"On the heels of a $40 million experiment that caught mainstream media attention, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are taking another step into mass consciousness today as Kimbal Musk – the billionaire Tesla board member and brother of fellow entrepreneur Elon Musk – is announcing the opening of membership applications for Big Green DAO, a Web 3 charity focusing on food justice.In an interview with CoinDesk, Musk said that one of the goals of the charity is to overhaul the philanthropy industry with the use of blockchain-based tooling – a sector he believes is plagued by inefficiencies.Big Green is launching at a time when DAOs appear poised to follow non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as the next blockchain tech-based acronym to enter public conversation. Search engine interest in the organizations, nominally leaderless online investment collectives that are jokingly referred to as “group chats with a bank account,” is at a multiyear high following the capers of ConstitutionDAO, a collective of 17,000 donors who raised millions to purchase a rare print of the Constitution of the United States of America.Ultimately, Musk’s experiment is a daring step from a public figure risking personal and professional reputation to embrace often sneered-upon technology, and a validation for the many developers and builders who advanced DAO tooling in recent years.First stepsMusk’s venture into blockchain began in earnest “a year ago,” spurred on by other billionaires – including his sibling, who was recently and perhaps incorrectly crowned richest man in the world – getting involved in Bitcoin.“There was Michael Saylor’s loud-and-proud investment, followed by my brother’s decision to participate at Tesla, and I’m on the board at Tesla – just as a responsible board member I had to spend more time on it,” he said in an interview.Quickly he determined that crypto can be divided into two camps: what he calls the “speculators” and “the religious.”Story continues“The religious are awesome,” he told CoinDesk. “They are total believers that this will decentralize the world, change governance, bring power back to the masses. It’s a beautiful conversation when you’re connected to someone religious about it.”Nonetheless, the speculative noise – what the DAO scholar Paul Dylan-Ennis refers to as “the moat of trash” – nearly turned him off on the sector. Musk emphasized that he largely doesn’t even like investing his money in the stock market, and it was only the true believers that “kept him digging.”“When someone is religious about something, I need to find out why. There’s some bad religions out there, but for the most part, there’s usually something underneath it all tying people together,” he said.The thing tying people together in Web 3, according to Musk, is primarily community creation.“It’s community like I’ve never seen it before. I’m a restaurant guy in my non-tech life, and I love that it brings people together, so that kept me interested. And the fact that it decentralizes power – that’s interesting to me. I’ve always had a healthy disrespect for the authorities,” he said.Crypto influenceOnce Musk decided to start a Web 3 community of his own, he sought to surround himself with advisors both from the cryptosphere and from traditional finance.While early conversations with crypto-natives (including members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible token (NFT) community, who he speaks fondly of) steered him toward projects that would create speculative assets – using a NFT drop to raise funds for charity, for instance – Musk’s initial focus for his Big Green DAO venture is on pure philanthropy.His right-hand man in the effort is Matthew Markman, a Ph.D. candidate and a “DAO facilitator” for metaverse gaming community Decentraland, as well as a project manager and community moderator for two other projects – one of Web 3′s many prolific, assiduous polymaths.Markman and Musk were connected via a mutual friend, Bear Kittay, a Web 3 investor and former Burning Man spokesperson. From there, the project’s network of crypto advisors grew to include Synthetix founder Kain Warwick, venture capital maven Vinny Lingham, frequent DAO contributor Priyanka Desai and ConsenSys executive Mike Kriak, among others.Musk reports being “overwhelmed” with the “positive energy” he’s received from the crypto community.“It’s not normal for me to have that degree of a warm welcome. The amount of people who would spend 20 hours on a whitepaper, just so my reputation wouldn’t be hurt – it’s my reputation! I thought that was very cool,” he said.ArchitectureSo far, the public response to Big Green DAO, whose white paper was released last week, has been overwhelmingly positive.“In the past few days when we released it, we expected trolls to go nuts. I don’t think we got a single Twitter troll. For me, I get involved in a lot of things – cool, world-positive things – and you always get trolls. Not one,” beamed Musk.According to Markman, the DAO’s architecture is the product of significant research, and it largely builds on pre-existing models.“I drew a lot from Decentraland DAO, I was looking at Uniswap, I was looking at Olympus DAO, I was just looking at every single DAO I could come across, their voting processes and their structures, to figure out what would work best for us,” said Markman.The DAO leverages a multi-tier system including an executive committee and a broader voting community.Big Green DAO's organizational schematic. (Big Green DAO)At the advice of project advisor and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood, the DAO took steps to ensure it could remain registered as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. This means the DAO is under the purview of a legal entity’s charter, which requires the group to focus on food justice, and the executive committee can vote down spurious proposals to ensure compliance.When it comes to voting on grants distribution, however, power is largely in the hands of DAO members, and Markman is aiming to experiment with ranked-choice voting (which involves tinkering with DAO voting platform Snapshot’s base functionalities with a homebrewed user interface).Read more: Popular DAO Voting Platform Snapshot Labs Raises $4M“The goal was to make a DAO that would have a flexible, agile process that we can’t have in our material voting systems. It’s difficult to say, change how we vote on one issue in our everyday voting, where in a DAO we can program different ways to vote for different systems,” Markman said.One of the greatest challenges Markman anticipates is going to be initiating food justice workers in the tenets of Web 3.“We’re going to have more surprises than you see in a lot of DAOs, because we don’t have a social context going into it. We’re bringing in a lot of people who are distributed from a different space, and they’re not used to organizing online. We have to develop the social structures as we’re developing the social and governance structures,” he said.However, the ultimate goal of the project is to enable frontline food justice workers to choose not just who gets the money, but also who gets the power in the organization.Said Musk: “The core appeal of a DAO is a thesis: If we put the grantmaking authority in the hands of the frontlines, will it make a bigger impact than keeping the decision-making centralized?”Tested theoriesFor crypto-natives, Musk’s thesis has already largely been proven true.In 2019, MolochDAO – a DAO designed to raise and distribute funds from ecosystem contributors for Ethereum infrastructure – led to a resurgence of interest in the tooling and design space in the wake of the collapse of The DAO, a 2016 cooperative investment experiment.MolochDAO has since been repeatedly forked, leading to successful organizations such as MetaCartel and The LAO, and ultimately spurring a DAO renaissance that has continued into 2021.More recently, the Gitcoin DAO has successfully distributed over $40 million in grants for public goods infrastructure based on community voting.Early DAO pioneers, such as MolochDAO’s Ameen Soleimani, say that DAO infrastructure is ideal for charitable organizations because of the transparency of voting and use of funds, the lack of operational overhead, and the ability for groups to quickly reach and act on consensus.Read more: DAOs May Be the Future of Work, but Don’t Bet on Them Being the Next Big Asset ClassThat transparency and direct funding are exactly the qualities Big Green DAO is looking to bring to real-world philanthropy.“The majority of funds in philanthropy end up going towards expenses with giving and accepting money. There’s so much excess waste in paying for procedures and bureaucracy,” said Markman.Empathy without egoUltimately, Musk is hoping Big Green DAO can overhaul the structure of real-world philanthropy – a sector that accounts for $800 billion in annual of giving that he and Markman see as ripe for disruption.“I’ve been to the Gates Foundation in Seattle – it’s like the United Nations. It’s the biggest building in the city. It’s got thousands of people who work there. I do think they have good intentions, but they’re spending a fortune on their overhead, and there isn’t a lot of transparency,” said Musk.Musk noted that “it’s Bill’s money, so whatever” and that he doesn’t want to criticize the charitable work of others, but DAOs offer a leaner, alternative model.“Why do we need an office? We’re so decentralized that we couldn’t fill one,” he said.Markman also took aim at the “ego bloat” that comes with big-budget, big-name giving. Not only can “we can take out a lot of the middlemen,” but DAO-based charities can also decentralize away the shadow of a megadonor founder.“The idea in the 2000s was a lean startup, and what we’re doing here is trying to create a lean organization,” said Markman.‘It will work’Big Green DAO’s initial efforts are scheduled to last a year and distribute over $1 million in funds. After that point, Musk and his team will take pause and assess to what degrees the DAOO structure allowed the organization to reach its goals.“We’ve given ourselves an out to say, ‘This experiment didn’t work,’ but we feel very bullish that it will work,” he said. “To be clear, this is an experiment. If this doesn’t work, we’ll go back to the drawing board and try it a different way.”He noted that he’s committed to seeing his thesis play out, and that if the DAO fails for any reason the team will continue to tinker with the mechanics rather than abandon the tools.According to Markman, it’s a coming-out moment for DAOs and the DAO community, which has been paving the way for projects like Big Green for years:“We have a lot of crypto-native folks, and we have a lot of people who have never touched a wallet, never considered being here, were terrified of this space – and we’re bringing those communities together. It’s an important step in increasing adoption and adaptation of these technologies, systems, and social structures we’ve been keeping in our little echo chamber for a while.”","November 30, 2021, 8:05 AM"

Shiba inu started in August 2020 as almost a copycat coin to dogecoin, the original meme cryptocurrency, and has grown about 80,000 times in value this year, making it one of the crypto stars of 2021.Before Kraken's announcement late on Monday, the coin had come under pressure along with other cryptocurrencies including bitcoin, which slid as concern grew over the economic impact of the Omicron coronavirus variant that was first identified in southern Africa late last week.Kraken announced in a blog post Monday it would start offering shiba inu the following day. The coin is now tradable against the US dollar and the euro, and the minimum tradable amount is 50,000 shiba inu.The exchange teased earlier this month that it would list the coin on November 2 if its Twitter post got 2,000 likes. The post garnered 60,000 likes, but Kraken backed down from its pledge, saying it was moving ""through its listing process,"" prompting a backlash from shiba inu fans.The shiba inu community has been anticipating the coin's listing on exchanges, and people have even made a petition for the retail-trading platform Robinhood to list the coin.
