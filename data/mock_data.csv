China has banned the private use of cryptocurrencies, making all cryptocurrency-related business activities illegal. The recently passed $1 trillion US infrastructure bill brings tougher rules on crypto-trading taxes. Meantime, some developing nations are embracing crypto.El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender in September with the hope of bettering its economy and Zimbabwe is considering doing the same. The biggest companies in the world are already using blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrency, including Amazon, Cargill, CVS, IBM, Seagate, and Visa. CEOs including Elon Musk, Richard Branson, and Jack Dorsey, and government officials such as Miami Mayor Francis Suarez and incoming New York Mayor Eric Adams, have all voiced support for cryptocurrency and its wider adoption.Meantime, North America has become the world's biggest victim of ransomware attacks - paying a hefty $131 million in cryptocurrency to criminals in just one year amid the rapid rise of cryptocurrency adoption, a new study by Chainalysis showed.Story continuesMost of the crypto-based attacks were associated with Russia-based cybercriminal groups, the study added.Clinton's concerns about crypto were ""spot-on,"" economic regulations expert John Reed Stark, who spent 11 years as the chief of the SEC's Office of Internet Enforcement, told Insider.""The investment in cryptocurrency goes against every basic rule of investor protection,"" Stark told Insider. ""Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies trade on platforms that don't have any of the safety mechanisms that traditional exchanges have.""Clinton also addressed the topic of cybersecurity during the panel in relation to foreign disinformation campaigns and cyberwarfare that continue to pose challenges to the US and other Western states.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 22, 2021, 1:14 AM"

Photo: Marvin Recinos/AFP via GettyBitcoin (BTC-USD) was down by more than 2.5% on Monday morning, trading at $57,622 (£42,840).The fall comes as the president of El Salvador announced plans to build a 'bitcoin city' in the country at a promotional Bitcoin event in the coastal town of Mizata late on Saturday.President Nayib Bukele said the city will be circular to mimic the shape of a large coin, and will be built at the base of Conchagua volcano in order to harness its geothermal energy to power bitcoin mining as well as supply energy to the city. The construction and infrastructure of the city will be financed partly by an issue of $1bn in sovereign bonds backed by the cryptocurrency, Bukele said. The city will have no property, income or capital gains taxes, with costs covered by a sales tax and money raised by the bond issues.Bukele estimated that the construction of the public infrastructure would cost around 300,000 bitcoins.The bonds will be issued in 2022 and the construction of the city will begin 60 days later, according to the government.Read more: FTSE rises as COVID returns to haunt Europe and oil hits eight-week lowSamson Mow, chief strategy officer of blockchain technology company Blockstream joined Bukele onstage at the promotional Bitcoin event.He said the bonds will be US dollar-denominated 10-year bonds, with half the funds converted to bitcoin and the other half used for infrastructure and bitcoin mining.In September, El Salvador became the first country in the world to introduce bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the US dollar.The government launched a digital wallet known as the Chivo wallet and offered $30 worth of bitcoin to people who downloaded it.More than 200 new cash machines were also installed across the country and businesses were compelled to accept the cryptocurrency as payment, wherever possible.Bitcoin's price on Monday. Chart: Yahoo Finance UKThe move was presented as a way to boost economic development and jobs, but sparked protests across the country where 32.7% of the population remain below the poverty line and only 58% have access to the internet, which is necessary for bitcoin transactions.After some initial teething problems when the bitcoin price dropped and the Chivo wallet crashed, Bukele had said that millions of Salvadoreans were using the app.Story continuesBetween September and October, Salvadoreans living abroad sent around $32m in remittances back home using the Chivo wallet, according to the country’s Central Reserve Bank chief. That represents about 2.5% of all the remittances sent in those months.In the US on Monday, asset manager Invesco announced its decision to halt plans to launch a Bitcoin Strategy exchange traded fund (ETF) just hours before the fund was due to list in New York.Invesco said regulatory constraints would make it too expensive for investors. Read more: CBI calls for regional economic clusters to level up UKOne issue was that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) was only planning to allow ETFs with 100% exposure to bitcoin futures. Invesco, meanwhile, wanted a portfolio that was a mix of futures, swaps, physical bitcoin, ETFs and private funds investing in the bitcoin industry, to help protect investors in the event of a liquidity crunch.It would have been the second such ETF to launch, after the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) debuted in October.Major cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin down on Monday, with ethereum, the world's second-largest crypto by market cap, falling 3% to trade at $4,217.Ethereum's price on Monday.

It accounts for a majority of new infections in the country, outpacing the highly-transmissible Delta variant.Two cases of B.1.1.529 were discovered in Hong Kong earlier this month.

That said, bitcoin is showing no signs of slowing down with mainstream adoption likely to gain further momentum in the year ahead.”Last month, Ethereum overtook the value of JPMorgan Chase for the first time and is currently the world’s 15th most valuable asset with a market cap of more than half a trillion dollars – $10bn more than JPMorgan’s.Story continuesData from global assets aggregator CompaniesMarketCap shows that Ethereum is also ahead of payments giants Matercard, PayPal and Visa.Read MoreEthereum price smashes record high amid metaverse and NFT buzzWhat’s going on with ethereum?

Based on technical indicators, Bitcoin’s downside is capped at $53k, which suggests buyers will remain active towards $60K resistance.As part of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, strong dollar amid reports of an Indian Crypto ban trading volumes continue to decline. Although some analysts expect volatility to increase as November draws to a close in the bitcoin and ether options marketsPrices could move sharply over the next few days due to rising volatility, which could discourage buyers from holding onto positions for an extended period of time.Whales deposit Bitcoins at exchanges. Curiously, the exchanges have continued to outflow money, which has resulted in the reserves remaining near their lowest levels since mid-2018.In a report somewhat contradictory, Glassnode said long-term holders may not be spending as much as they were and are therefore more likely to be adding to positions than exiting them.There are two confluences on the chart from a technical perspective: the first is the 38% Fibonacci retracement level, and the second is the trendline that dates back to March 2020 and serves as support.Once the level is successfully backtested as support, it is possible that the uptrend will resume. On the other hand, the 50-day MA (*$60.6K), as well as $60K, seem to be the main immediate resistance levels.Bears might still have some runway left due to the constant trading volume during this correction. This calls for caution.As the RSI is making higher lows on the 4-hour chart, there are signs of bullish divergence, even though the RSI is falling on the daily time frame (but hasn’t reached oversold conditions yet). In order to confirm it, Bitcoin must hold above $53K and rise meaningfully.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Shiba Inu Keeps Moving Lower As Whale Transactions Fail To Provide Enough SupportEthereum Price Prediction – Bulls Take Control with an Eye on $4,500AS Monaco, A French Football Club, Adopts CryptoEuropean Equities: FOMC Meeting Minutes to Set the Tone ahead of Key Stats from GermanyGold And Silver Face Strong Pressure As Short-Term Yields RiseStripe is Open to Accepting Crypto Payments Again","November 24, 2021, 11:37 PM"

Ether, on the other hand, on Wednesday managed to bounce off of its own such trendline.The second-largest token sees good round-number technical support at $4,000, according to Mike McGlone, a commodities analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It seems to be a battle with the leveraged longs from higher levels getting flushed and the longer-term, more institutional bid below the market,” he said. McGlone sees Ether consolidating its bull run within the $4,000 to $5,000 range.Cryptocurrencies have sold off in recent days amid a number of concerns, including greater regulatory risks as well as many tokens having run up very quickly in a short period of time. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which measures the performance of a handful of the largest tokens, has lost 14% so far this month.News that India is preparing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies appears to be behind the latest leg of the selloff in Bitcoin on Wednesday on exchanges popular with Indian investors. Bitcoin was down almost 14% at one point on WazirX while little changed elsewhere.Some analysts are also citing waning risk appetite in the broader equities market, where profitless technology companies have suffered the brunt of the declines.“We see Bitcoin come off in valuation when we see a selloff in the more speculative parts of the equity market,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said by phone.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Bitcoin lost as much as 3.1% to trade at $55,908, while Ether fell 4.2% at one point to $4,168.The important thing is that both Ether and Bitcoin held their lows from last week, according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Those lows -- $55,500 on XBT and $4,000 on XET -- are the more important short-term support levels.”Although Bitcoin has seen a sharp pullback within its intermediate-term uptrend, it is showing signs of short-term downside exhaustion per a number of indicators, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, an independent research firm focused on technical analysis. Plus, its oversold conditions increase the probability that it’s put a low into place.“We expect Bitcoin to resume its intermediate-term uptrend, allowing it to ultimately break out above resistance near $65K for a long-term measured move projection of $90K,” she wrote in a note.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t HelpingWildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the BenefitsHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in AmericaBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","November 24, 2021, 9:10 AM"

Avax has rallied this year along with the rest of the crypto complex, but what gave it this most recent boost was its tie-up with ""Big Four"" accounting firm Deloitte.""Avalanche has climbed 37% over the last 7 days whilst the rest of the top 10 cryptos have seen red. The significant driving factor for AVAX's entrance into the top 10 was the partnership with Deloitte, one of the ""Big Four"" accounting organizations and the largest professional services network in the world,"" GlobalBlock sales trader Freddie Williams said.Avalanche developer Ava Labs announced last Tuesday that it would partner with Deloitte to help simplify reimbursement applications for victims of natural disasters.Avax has rallied by almost 50% since then and was last up around 1.5% in 24 hours to $136.50 by 06:01 a.m. ET on Monday, according to Coingecko. Bitcoin meanwhile has lost almost 5% in that time, while dogecoin has shed around 6% and ether has fallen by 2%.Story continues""The new platform gives state and local officials a decentralized, low-cost and fully immutable system that empowers both the grant funders, and the aid recipients, while using the transparency of blockchain to minimize fraud, waste and abuse,"" Emin Gün Sirer, Ava Labs founder, tweeted Tuesday.Most major digital coins have come under fire this month, as factors such a stronger dollar, more evidence of China's crackdown on the sector and the potential for higher taxes on cryptocurrencies stemming from the new US infrastructure bill have weighed on the market.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 22, 2021, 3:22 AM"

The fund closed above its $30 million goal and has put money behind Bitwave, Lattice and BlockchainSpace.Asked to compare the Endeavor Fund to the NFT Fund, Maitra said Endeavor looks at early-stage investments across many sectors, including NFTs and gaming, but will predominantly invest in companies supporting NFT growth via equity and token investments.“The NFT fund focuses on investing in the actual NFTs themselves, many of which have immediate cash flows and yields and unique properties that accrue directly to the token holder,” Maitra told CoinDesk.Investment focuses for the Arca NFT Fund will include digital property, in-game assets, art and collectibles and how NFTs interact with decentralized finance (DeFi), to name a few.Arca’s NFT fund marks the latest venture capital bet on digital assets. In a research note published last month, Bank of America said VC investments in the sector surpassed $17 billion for the first half of 2021, up from $5.5 billion in the same period last year.","November 24, 2021, 8:50 AM"

21,21.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-restaurant-chain-canada-plowing-131500841.html,A small restaurant chain in Canada is plowing all of its profits into bitcoin. Its returned 460% on its investment and is tripling locations during the pandemic,"Aly Hamam (right), co-founder of Tahinis, shows a bitcoin ATM at one of its restaurants.TahinisTahinis is a family-based restaurant chain that invests all its profit in bitcoin, a strategy that's ""worked like a charm"" as it expands.Tahinis's co-founders say they're up 460% on the investment first made in August 2020 as a way to protect profit from surging inflation.The Canadian company says it's helped other small businesses adopt a ""bitcoin-standard"" strategy.Tahinis is a family-based restaurant chain that along with its Middle Eastern cuisine serves this advice to small-business owners everywhere: Invest in bitcoin.Tahinis is billed as the world's first restaurant chain to invest 100% of its cash reserves into the cryptocurrency. Its founders, brothers Aly and Omar Hamam, said bitcoin exposure has been key in aiding its expansion in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and soaring inflation that's sent prices soaring for ingredients they need for shawarma and other dishes. The company based in London, Ontario, Canada, first invested in bitcoin in August 2020.""We're up, to date, 460% on our initial investment and we didn't stop there,"" Tahinis chief marketing officer, Aly, told Insider in a recent interview. ""We will continue sweeping excess profit into bitcoins. We even bought the [April 2021 price] top and then rode it all the way down, and we just kept buying month after month after month. So it has worked like a charm for us,"" he said.Bitcoin in August 2020 traded under $12,000. It was around $58,075 as of Friday after last week's record high above $69,000.Tahinis follows a so-called ""bitcoin-standard strategy"" under which it operates in fiat currency, or Canadian dollars, then invests all profit into bitcoin, a move Aly said was similar to that of MicroStrategy's.The data analytics company uses excess cash to purchase what it sees as a ""dependable store of value."" MicroStrategy recently held 114,042 bitcoins, valued at about $6.8 billion as of Thursday. Aly for a while had ignored bitcoin after one of his financial idols - Warren Buffett - called it ""rat poison squared"" in 2018.Story continuesTahinis keeps working capital in cash for a few months and then the profit, part of its treasury, is sent into bitcoin. Privately owned Tahinis couldn't disclose how much bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet but said sales at its restaurants now exceed $8 million over the past year.The company in 2021 will expand to nine locations from eight and is on track in 2022 to have a total of 29 restaurants. Aly said Tahinis has worked with dozens of small businesses worldwide onboarding them to a bitcoin-standard strategy.""The main problem that we have right now is that dollars are devaluating,"" Aly said. ""Central banks will say inflation is only 5%. But that really depends on what you want to buy. Poultry is up 45%, beef is up 25%, imported goods and spices are up 65%, oils are up 110%,"" since March 2020, when the pandemic was accelerating, he said. ""So it made sense to put our money into [bitcoin] and that will outstrip any inflation rates we see for the coming decade.""The Hamams are sensitive to currency devaluation after seeing their parents' wealth and savings hurt by a 65% drop in the Egyptian pound against the US dollar between 2012 and 2017. The brothers were in Tahrir Square in 2011 during the Arab Spring uprising that led to the ouster of then-President Hosni Mubarak.""We faced the riot police, we got hit with tear gas,"" said Aly. ""We came to Canada the following year with a reinvigorated hope to start our new lives here,"" which led to Tahinis. The Hamams had previously obtained dual citizenship through their father who earned a Ph.D. in Canada and later worked as a mathematics professor in Saudi Arabia.Tahinis has installed bitcoin machines in every restaurant to encourage employees and customers to buy the cryptocurrency. It doesn't take bitcoin for food payments in part because accounting and tax reporting is much easier to operate in fiat currency and it wants to promote holding bitcoin.Tahinis started recovering from the pandemic in May 2020 after sales plummeted by 80% and forced layoffs. Along with bitcoin, having a quick-service restaurant model rather than an in-person dining model requiring more square footage to operate has helped.""We had more people sign up for franchises after COVID than before COVID,"" Omar Hamam, Tahinis CEO, told Insider.""We have a full marketing team that works every day to push out content to make people laugh,"" and to see Tahinis's food on TikTok and Instagram, said Omar, ""and that we have our own supply-chain company helps a lot. So we've really tackled the business from every aspect.""Read the original article on Business Insider","November 22, 2021, 5:10 AM"

Bitcoin is being heralded as an inflation hedge on a par with gold and ether is rapidly becoming the cryptocurrency of choice for decentralized finance, play-to-earn games, digital collectors' items, known as non-fungible tokens, and likely soon, the metaverse.But it's not either of these two cryptocurrencies that have captured the public's imagination.Dogecoin, which was founded by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmers in 2013 as a joke, has been the most searched-for cryptocurrency in the largest number of states so far this year, according to research by The Advisor Coach, a financial advisor. The coin, which is based on an internet meme of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog, was the most-googled in 23 states, including Florida, Illinois and Michigan.This year, it shot to prominence, thanks in large part to the Twitter-based cheerleading of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who is a known crypto enthusiast that holds dogecoin, bitcoin and ether. Musk even went so far as saying in May this year that he might accept dogecoin as payment for his company's electric vehicles.By that point, dogecoin was already beloved among the army of Reddit retail traders, who had pushed the coin up to around $0.07, from closer to $0.007 at the start of the year and Musk's payment remark sent the price to a record $0.70. It's since eased to around $0.24, but it's still one of the crypto stars of 2021, with a gain of nearly 5,000% so far.Story continues""The rise in interest can be partially attributed to the endorsement of Elon Musk who stated earlier in the year that Tesla would accept dogecoin as a form of payment,"" The Advisor Coach note said.Crypto traders' adoration of Musk extends well beyond what coins he holds and has given rise to dogecoin spinoffs. The Tesla boss even owns a Shiba Inu. There's now a shiba inu coin, and even a floki inu, named after Musk's real-life pup, Floki.By contrast, bitcoin, the biggest and original cryptocurrency, was the most-searched for in just 10 states, including Connecticut, Alaska and Mississippi, ranking it second in the list. Bitcoin has led the surge in appetite for and adoption of cryptocurrencies. The total market value of crypto assets is hovering at close to $3 trillion, having risen from around $500 billion a year earlier, according to CoinGecko.Ether came in third place, being the most searched in eight states, while shiba inu landed in fourth place. Interestingly, shiba inu was the most-searched for cryptocurrency in New York, home to Wall Street and the country's most powerful financial institutions.Map of crypto google searchesThe Advisor CoachRead the original article on Business Insider","November 24, 2021, 6:30 AM"

And this week, it was all about the ConstitutionDAO.For those who weren't online last week, here's what you missed: a not-so-subtle group of strangers on the internet banded together to try to buy one of the remaining thirteen copies for the constitution. With crypto. The bold bid eventually fell short, but many saw it as an inspiring onramp into how communities can mobilize around a shared goal in a Web3 world. The whole movement, from its meme start to its poetic, and billionaire Ken Griffin-themed, end, was just too interesting for Equity to not dedicate an entire episode to.So, Natasha and Alex brought on Lucas Matney and Anita Ramaswamy to unpack, decompress, and bond over our shared experience of witnessing this 'financial flash mob.'We talked about what a DAO is, and what they might be used for. We dug into the question of just how many folks the effort really brought to the larger ""Web3"" space. And, of course, we had to talk about gas fees, NFTs, and the pace of innovation in crypto more broadly. Lucas even broke out an excellent analogy to explain level-two chains!The crew were generally bullish on the blockchain economy, if skeptical of some of its current uses. In short, the potential remains potent in crypto even if some of its projects, today at least, are a bit more boring than breakthrough. Crypto,we're told, is going to shake up the world.

It also dominated the news cycle late Friday after Citadel CEO Ken Griffin revealed that he defeated the loosely-organized group of investors in a bidding war that broke records.So, what's next for the DAO? A couple of things.""We'll soon be proposing a plan that outlines governance, vision, and values, for the community to review and comment on,"" the group said in a five-part Twitter thread Sunday.But generally speaking, it proposed two routes for the cohort of around 17,000 people who banded together to raise an extraordinary sum.First, investors who want to opt out can get their ""ETH back at the original rate,"" the group said. For easier tracking of claimed and unclaimed funds, the group added it will make a website in the coming week in block 13656500.The DAO did remind investors on its existing website of gas fees, which are required in every transaction. Some, especially those new to the digital asset ecosystem, may have failed to realize this at the get-go.Second, investors who want to invest in another object can sign a message — without paying for gas — committing their funds to the DAO's treasury and getting the group's token called WTP, the group said.WTP stands for We The People, which gives holders the ability to vote for what direction future efforts of the DAO will take. There is no expectation to profit when donating to ConstitutionDAO.DAOs are internet communities that pull capital together and decide collectively how to invest it. ConstitutionDAO started as a joke on Twitter after Sotheby's announced the sale of one of 13 remaining copies of the US Constitution.Story continuesLast week, Griffin won the auction and purchased the 1787 copy for $43.2 million, a new world record for the most valuable historical document ever sold at an auction. The CEO said he intends to lend it to an Arkansas art museum for free.ConstitutionDAO on its website admitted it was disappointed its ethereum-based project did not succeed in achieving its goal but decided to end the Twitter thread on an optimistic note.""We onboarded thousands into crypto and educated millions about DAOs.

29,29.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/proshares-bitcoin-futures-etf-wins-142427863.html,ProShares Bitcoin Futures ETF Wins ‘First Mover Advantage’ as VanEck Launch Falls Flat,"VanEck investments’ newly listed bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) saw limited uptake when it launched last week. Some analysts say that’s unsurprising since a rival bitcoin futures ETF launched by ProShares several weeks earlier appears to have leapt to a first-mover advantage.As of Friday, the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF – stock ticker BITO – had net assets of $1.4 billion. It was the first bitcoin futures ETF to go live in October after winning the approval of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Such assets dwarf the $57 million for Valkyrie’s bitcoin futures ETF (ticker BTF), launched a few days later, and the $8.7 million reported for the VanEck ETF, which didn’t come to market until last week.The ProShares ETF held onto its dominance even though it’s a more expensive investment vehicle, with a higher net expense ratio, at 0.95%, than the VanEck ETF (ticker XBTF), at 0.65%.“It is harder to gain traction when you come to market weeks later,” Todd Rosenbluth, the head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research told CoinDesk.ProShares $1 billionThe first-mover advantage was initially visible from reports on trading volume.When the VanEck’s bitcoin futures ETF started trading last week on the Chicago-based CBOE exchange, it drew only around $5 million of first-day volume.The ProShares ETF, by contrast, hit a trading volume of about $1 billion by the end of its first day.Deborah Fuhr, managing partner and founder of ETFGI, which tracks the ETF industry, said that “there is a significant first-mover advantage in the ETFs and ETPs business.“First mover takes most of the assets and trading volume,” she said. “This is a phenomenon that has existed in the U.S. for many years.”Bitcoin ETFsThe cool reception for XBTF looks like a double disappointment for the sponsor, since VanEck’s application for a spot bitcoin ETF – backed by actual units of the cryptocurrency, rather than futures contracts – was rejected by the SEC on Nov. 12.Story continuesValkyrie Funds CEO Leah Wald said the Van Eck ETF launch may have simply been a victim of bad timing: launching into a broad sell-off in digital asset markets. Bitcoin (BTC) prices fell about 10% in the seven days through Sunday, the biggest weekly decline in two months.The ProShares ETF, by contrast, launched just as bitcoin was pressing toward a new all-time high just below $69,000.“The factors that contributed to the down market had nothing to do with them and can be chalked up to nothing more than a bit of bad luck,” Wald said. “Let’s not forget that other much larger asset managers were unable to achieve launching such a product. Bringing a BTC futures fund to market is a victory on its own. Unlike those firms, Van Eck at least has a seat at the table.”She went on to stress that launching an ETF is about much more than just day one, adding that Valkyrie Funds continues to see “robust demand in BTF.”“Since the moment we launched our fund, we expected this to be about more than launch day, and continue to believe that is the case,” said Wald.She added that there clearly is demand for exposure to bitcoin in a compliant, regulated vehicle and doesn’t expect that enthusiasm to wane anytime soon.“Winning hearts and minds is a long-term effort,” Wald said. “We are still in the top of the first inning.”Key Bitcoin Price Level at $60KThe launch of VanEck’s bitcoin futures ETF was “unexpectedly later than announced,” so it’s possible that investors who were interested in a bitcoin futures ETF had already placed their bets, said Laurent Kssis, director of CEC Capital, a crypto trading advisory firm.“This is a temporary glitch coupled with the higher volatility of bitcoin, which has scared new and existing investors as BTC dropped from its high and broke below the important $60K level,” he said. “So for now, new investors are holding back on what could lead to further downward pressures.”Read more: VanEck Bitcoin Futures ETF Finds Cool Reception","November 22, 2021, 6:24 AM"

It tops the list with 21%, followed by a trio of South American countries looking to get involved. Once again, the United States sits at the opposite end of the spectrum, with just 3.9% – approximately 13m Americans – saying they have an interest in buying one.Commenting on the NFT space, finder.com’s cryptocurrency editor, Keegan Francis, spoke of the growing popularity and earnings potential attached to digital artworks.“In some of these countries, people are quitting their jobs because they can make money trading NFTs or earning them in games. They can be a great gateway to cryptocurrency ownership, especially because many games don’t require ID,” he said.“If you want to buy NFTs directly then you’ll need to set up a wallet, purchase cryptocurrency, and choose an NFT marketplace.”","November 24, 2021, 9:43 AM"

The only thing stopping the wasteland’s evil forces from escaping was a magical wall maintained by five kingdoms. But as war brewed, the wall began to crumble.What happens next? That’s for you to decide.At least, that was the initial plan for “Realms of Ruin,” a collaborative storytelling project helmed by former Facebook executive Julie Zhuo and a team of best-selling young adult (YA) fantasy and science-fiction authors. Marie Lu, Tahereh Mafi, Ransom Riggs, Adam Silvera, David Yoon and Nicola Yoon were all signed on.The established authors involved in the project planned to kick-start the story with origin lore and 12 character backstories, and then hand over the reins to the “Realms of Ruin” community for dreaming up new characters and story lines within the universe.Built on the Solana blockchain, fans could mint their stories as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), buy and trade character art NFTs and talk with one another on Discord about the universe they were building. The authors would, according to an archived version of the project’s now-defunct website, “be reading closely to decide which stories and characters are compelling enough to become canon.”Essentially author-approved fan fiction for the Web 3 age, “Realms of Ruin” seemed exciting and ambitious – some even described it as inevitable – until a teaser for the project launched on Twitter and Instagram on Oct. 20.Instead of eager fans, the authors were met with suspicion that quickly turned to collective anger.The online writing community banded together to discuss the apparent dangers of the project. Twitter users decried the environmental impact of NFTs, accused the authors of running a Ponzi scheme and a grift to steal contributors’ intellectual property and debated the morality of marketing the project to minors.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.In less than five hours, “Realms of Ruin” was scrapped. The authors involved deleted their earlier announcements and replaced them with apologies. Before long, the apologies were deleted, too, along with other mentions of the project online. Book Twitter celebrated its victory.Story continuesNo matter that Solana, a proof-of-stake blockchain, didn’t intersect at all with the environmental costs for which “Realms of Ruin” was being pilloried. Proof-of-work, the energy-intensive technology behind the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains that requires specialized computers to “mine” new coins, has long drawn the ire of crypto skeptics. Proof-of-stake has no such mechanism.The controversy revealed a rich vein of mainstream distrust of crypto projects, especially when environmental impact is involved. It also showed there’s no room for technical nuance in the heat of online battle.‘Climate’ catastropheThe negative reaction to “Realms of Ruin” was nearly instantaneous. Book Twitter expressed a range of issues with the project, the most common of which was the environmental impact of NFTs.Legitimate concerns gave way to hyperbole and misunderstandings as fans condemned the “absolute climate carnage of NFTs.”When Marie Lu, one of the authors involved with the project, tweeted that the Solana blockchain was “eco-friendly” and asked people to “Please do your homework before spreading misinformation,” fans mocked her.Read more: What Is Proof-of-Stake?“Marie Lu really said no babe, my NFTs only burn down a *quarter* of the Amazon rainforest, check your facts,” one account tweeted.When confused Twitter users asked for explanations of why NFTs were so bad, other members of the online writing community stepped in to explain, offering tweets and explainer threads that often cited articles about proof-of-work mining – if they cited anything at all.Crypto insiders were quickly outmatched.“It started with an assumption that Solana was incredibly destructive to the environment, which is not true,” Austin Federa, head of communications at Solana Labs, told CoinDesk. “Full stop, it takes about 10 times as much energy to boil water from room temperature than it takes to mint an NFT on Solana.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.A source close to the project who asked not to be named told CoinDesk that Solana was chosen for its comparative sustainability.Despite this, the source said the team still anticipated pushback about NFTs, which prompted them to add a section to the “Realms of Ruin” website about Solana’s energy usage.The site read: “While many popular NFT platforms use the Ethereum blockchain which consumes large amounts of energy and is extremely expensive, the Solana blockchain has transaction costs below $0.01 and is very energy efficient. In fact, in the time you spent reading this, your body has burnt more calories in energy than it takes to mint a story on the Solana blockchain!”But fans remained suspicious of Solana’s environmental impact. Rumors of the project being a scheme to pump Solana’s native SOL token exploded when one Twitter user pointed out a small rise in the coin’s price that correlated with the “Realms of Ruin” teaser announcement.“There’s never been an NFT project on Solana whose volume was significant enough to impact trading,” Federa said.Minting doesn’t cost a mintMisunderstandings about the cost to mint an NFT on Solana also swirled through Book Twitter.The now-deleted “Realms of Ruin” announcement teased a “robust collection of original character NFTs” (though the price of these NFTs was never listed or otherwise made clear to potential participants), and touted the “low transaction costs of Solana.”With little information to go on, fans on Twitter began to speculate as to the cost of minting NFTs. On the project’s Discord, which has also been deleted, potential participants asked moderators to explain the process of minting NFTs.“From what I’ve understood from the post in #announcements, you pay to have the story turned into an NFT,” one user wrote.“So, you’re basically paying to upload your story?” another asked.On Twitter, some users speculated that it could cost up to $300 to mint an NFT on Solana. To be fair, such fees are not unheard of on Ethereum, where transaction fees are much higher.“The average cost to mint and use an NFT on Solana is approximately 35 cents,” Federa told CoinDesk. “From a transaction fee perspective, the cost of actually issuing and setting up an NFT or transferring it to someone is pennies.”Discord users pushed back against moderators, and pointed out that the majority of crypto exchanges require customers to be over the age of 18. On Twitter, they denounced the immorality of marketing the project to teenagers (despite over half of young adult literature readers being, well, adults).A Discord moderator called “redshirt” tried to quell fans’ rising panic about the mining costs by telling them that there were tentative plans to establish a treasury that would be filled by a percentage of proceeds from each NFT sold – both the character NFTs and the NFTs of the stories themselves.“We’re hoping to have a way for people who can’t purchase SOL to request a small amount from our shared treasury for minting stories,” redshirt wrote. “That way anyone with a story to tell can create it. More info to come soon.”But the promise of “more info to come’' didn’t sit well with fans. Before long the authors involved with the project were getting what Federa described as “serious threats” from upset fans.“My understanding is they got like, not death threats, but like, ‘You’re a horrible person, you’re ruining people’s lives, you’re selling out…’ Like real vicious betrayal stuff,” Federa said.Who retains the IP?Potential participants also expressed concerns about the lack of clarity as to who would own the copyright and intellectual property on any stories published within the “Realms of Ruin” universe.Conflicting information on the “Realms of Ruin” website seems to have been the source for the majority of users’ fears. One disclaimer gave copyright to the six authors involved, but in the website’s FAQ section, the project’s leaders assert that fans “truly own the stories you write, we will help you mint (publish) your stories as NFTs. Once you have minted an NFT, we can never take it away from you.”“This does feel like a witch hunt, done in a way that was really, really unhelpful.”Lia Holland, Fight for the FutureAccording to Moish Peltz, a New York-based attorney who specializes in the intersection of NFTs and intellectual property, original works of authorship are covered by copyright protection laws the moment they are created and fixed in a tangible form – like NFTs – but the nature of fan fiction makes “Realms of Ruin” a more complicated case.“However, once [the participants] are given permission to create the derivative works, they would presumably maintain ownership of their derivative works, unless there was some agreement to the contrary,” said Peltz.CoinDesk’s source seconded this, and explained that the team intended to create a profit tree structure that would give varying percentages of any money generated from NFT sales to authors involved in a given story line – both the professional authors who kick-started the project, and the participants who created NFT stories in the “chain.”However, this profit tree was never fully fleshed out or detailed on the “Realms of Ruin” website, which added to fans’ confusion.Participants also expressed concerns about hypothetical future copyright issues, like how participants would be rewarded if “Realms of Ruin” was ever made into a movie or television series.According to Peltz, there was some validity in participants’ fears.“Nothing in [the ‘Realms of Ruin’ FAQ] speaks to what rights the project might have to use the submitted fan fiction and what rights might be reserved to authors, nor whether participants could expect to receive any financial considerations for the contributions of their fan fiction to the project,” Peltz told CoinDesk.Questions in the Discord piled up faster than redshirt could answer, and users began speculating and answering each other’s questions. It quickly became clear that redshirt and the other moderators simply didn’t have answers to a lot of the participants’ questions.“NFTs and copyright are still the wild west,” redshirt wrote in response to a user comment about copyright issues. “But we want to act in good faith and take feedback from you all to make this fair and a success.”But promises of good faith did nothing to staunch the flow of questions or the eddying fears in the Discord.Tech or culture?Aside from the six established authors associated with the effort, the names of the people involved with the project were never posted on the “Realms of Ruin” website. Zhuo – the former Facebook VP – seems to have spearheaded the project.In a now-deleted Medium post, Zhuo wrote that she’d been inspired by Loot, the text-based fantasy NFT game.“NFTs are in a renaissance,” Zhuo wrote. “But something seemed missing. Stories.”Read more: The Latest NFT Fad Is a Text-Based Fantasy Game Building BlockDespite the involvement of the established authors, “Realms of Ruin” appears to have operated as a tech venture rather than a publishing one. And unlike the dynamic and ever-changing tech industry, the publishing industry is known for its adherence to tradition and distrust of new technologies.In retrospect, it seems as though Zhuo and her team had an abundance of enthusiasm and a partially fleshed-out idea when the announcement dropped (although to be fair, the announcement came over two weeks ahead of the project’s planned release date, and the team could have figured out the sticking points before then).CoinDesk’s source said that no one on the team was expecting the hostility that the announcement was met with. But, in hindsight, the lack of clarity mixed with the tech-averse nature of the book community made “Realms of Ruin” a recipe for disaster.Could Web 3 fix publishing?Lia Holland, the campaigns and communications director at Fight for the Future – a non-profit that advocates for digital rights like privacy and net neutrality – was one of the first to step into the fray and defend Zhuo and the “Realms of Ruin” team.Holland, who is unaffiliated with the project, found out about “Realms of Ruin” not through her work with Fight for the Future, but through her speculative fiction writers’ group.As an author herself, Holland was appalled by Book Twitter’s knee-jerk reaction to what she saw as an innovative and potentially transformative approach to publishing.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Holland’s tweets also called attention to the rampant misinformation spreading on Twitter:“All these threads I’m reading are like ‘I don’t know anything about NFTs, please don’t make me learn. But I KNOW they are awful and going to melt the planet. No, I’m not reading the website to learn about how little energy their set up would use,’” she wrote.In a Fight for the Future podcast released the day after the project’s cancellation, Holland broke down the drama with her coworker, Ayele B. Hunt.According to Hunt, Book Twitter’s “nuclearly reactive” response to “Realms of Ruin” wasn’t totally unexpected.“Authors have been betrayed at every turn by the existing actors,” Hunt said, referring to Amazon and the traditional publishing industry. “Their suspicion of new things has a foundation in fact. These gatekeepers have toxified and toxified the space … and put investors over artists to the point that anything new can look like a scam.”In an interview with CoinDesk, Holland reiterated Hunt’s point.“Authors and people in the publishing space have been deeply betrayed, over and over again, by the existing structures they work in,” Holland said. “There’s been so much consolidation and concentration and lessening of resources for authors. The space, especially for people who are not published, is often full of traps and scams.”The deep well of skepticism is merited, she said.However, Holland remained emphatic that Book Twitter’s immediate negative reaction to the “Realms of Ruin” announcement was uncalled for.“This does feel like a witch hunt, done in a way that was really, really unhelpful and didn’t create enough space to have a conversation about this platform and what it was trying to do,” she said.","November 22, 2021, 6:30 AM"

Grayscale estimated that revenue from virtual gaming worlds could grow to $400 billion in 2025, from around $180 billion in 2020.Yet Grayscale, which runs the world's biggest cryptocurrency fund, said the metaverse is still ""in its early innings.""

Facebook, which has launched the virtual reality space Horizon Worlds, is an example.But increasingly, metaverse projects are created on or are heavily tied to crypto technology, which can give users more control and allow them to earn money that they can use in the real world. This is known as the Web3 metaverse.Grayscale listed the opportunities for monetization of consumers within the Web3 metaverse. These include art galleries launching NFTs, games and casinos where players win crypto, digital advertising billboards, and music venues where DJs and artists hold concerts.In the third quarter, total Web3 and NFT fundraising hit $1.8 billion, out of overall crypto fundraising of $8.2 billion, Grayscale said. It added that investment has ""recently started to accelerate.""Grayscale's report focused on Decentraland.

It seems society has suddenly propelled back to the future as we have seen nations start to adopt a phenomenon known to many as crypto — the world’s newest medium of exchange.The best way to describe crypto is as the digital currency it is, thinking of the many different types of cryptocurrency as currencies with different utilities. The one quality that they all share is that they contribute to the creation of a richer digital experience.The Bitcoin logo appears on the display screen of a cryptocurrency ATM at the Smoker’s Choice store in Salem, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)The challenging part is understanding that cryptocurrency fluctuates rapidly and can be volatile — sparking the interest of investors and micro-investors throughout the world who are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. Some experts believe cryptocurrency is all about timing and crypto-believers argue that cash and the USD is archaic and truly the inferior form of currency … but are these investors right?It is impossible to demystify the secret of cryptocurrency without answering the infamous question — what is blockchain? Often discussed in tandem, many mix up the idea of cryptocurrency with blockchain, and others simply don’t know the difference.Blockchain is a decentralized technology that is incredibly secure (think of the root of the word crypto — as in encryption). The benefit of blockchains is that its technology is spread across many different computer operating systems, thus arguably making them more secure than existing payment systems.Easily accessible crypto-wallets like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Gemini, have made it easy to buy and sell over 50 different cryptocurrencies. Gemini is particularly interesting because of its founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who started the company in 2014.If you ever watched The Social Network, you will remember the Winklevoss Twins — the two brothers that infamously founded HarvardConnection, a social media network on Harvard’s campus that predated Facebook. Although the Winklevoss brothers seemed to have lost the Facebook war, they continue to prove themselves as formidable opponents to Mark Zuckerberg in the “Metaverse”— going on to found one of cryptocurrency’s leading exchanges.Story continuesHowever, while the Winklevoss brothers have used this and their other investments to propel them into the billionaire stratosphere along with their rival Zuckerberg — cryptocurrency has always had a different meaning for Black and Brown people.For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberation. In this case, it comes as no surprise that Black people have been, by and large, leading the cryptocurrency boom. The University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center reports that 46% of cryptocurrency holders are people of color — with 18% of those holders being Black. These numbers make sense considering the deep seated distrust in the Black community surrounding government regulation and the wealth gap.The Bitcoin logo is displayed on the side of a Bitcoin ATM on November 10, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)To many, cryptocurrency will serve as the great equalizer that education was once viewed as in this country. Accessibility is another reason for cryptocurrency’s success within the Black community. Investors can purchase cryptocurrency at a painfully low entry point — you only need a dollar to buy crypto as you can fractionally invest in currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum buying a minute fraction of the coin.This enables folks with less disposable income to get in on the fun whereas the stock market has traditionally excluded these population groups. But cryptocurrency has implications that span far larger than just Black America. Cryptocurrency has also become a force to be reckoned with on the forefront of the global community. This has left many economists asking the question of what crypto means for the global economy?Akon was perhaps one of the first celebrities to openly discuss cryptocurrency and its ramifications, as early as 2018, when he declared his own cryptocurrency, Akoin. Akon noted that this cryptocurrency would guide Africa into financial freedom and be the basis upon which his futuristic city would be built.If Akon’s plan does succeed, it would liberate the Senegalese people from the French-backed CFA (the national currency of Senegal and many Francophone countries in West Africa). But Senegal isn’t the only African country interested in cryptocurrency. Nigeria has quickly grown to be the second largest market for crypto trading, following the United States.Akon attends the Jingle Bell Ball at the O2 Arena on December 5, 2010 in London, England. (Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)Many Nigerians have found the use of cryptocurrency as a solvent way to protect their money against the depreciation of the Naira (which is linked to the USD.) Moreover, cryptocurrency simplifies the transference of remittances (money sent back home by nationals or family members who live internationally) and minimizes costs and fees. The issue of remittances is a phenomenon that can be seen throughout the African continent and across the pond in the Caribbean and Latin America as well.El Salvador has led the Latin American community in cryptocurrency, becoming the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. Both President Nayib Bukele and Maria Luisa Hayem, El Salvador’s Minister of Economy, are proud to have led Latin America into this innovative economic revolution. Despite their efforts, adoption has been slow, with only 12% of consumers using cryptocurrency since the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in September.Yet not all countries have bought into the hype, with China banning all crypto-related transactions and deeming them illegal. Crypto economist and attorney Jamar Montgomery thinks it’s because “open source cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are a threat to a government’s control over a monetary and financial system.”While these governments desperately cling to the little financial control they have left — the rest of the world seems to be moving toward a new age. With even the infamous Los Angeles Staples Arena being renamed and rebranded to reflect a new moniker, “crypto.com,” it is certainly reflective of the new age of cryptocurrency.Wen-Kuni Ceant, theGrio.comWen-kuni Ceant is the CEO and Co-Founder of Politicking.

""With three open seats and the vice chair for supervision, there is still a lot of leeway for Biden to make a meaningful and distinct imprint on the trajectory of the Federal Reserve,"" said Kathryn Judge, a banking law professor at Columbia University.""The continuity Biden tried to signal is really a commitment to support the monetary policy and the focus on unemployment that Powell has spearheaded during his leadership, but there's a lot of other issues that could be addressed by the Federal Reserve in coming years.""Story continuesI'll tell you what that means here.LEADING THE DAYJobless claims plunge to 199K, lowest level since 1969New weekly claims for jobless aid plunged to the lowest level in more than 50 years last week, according to data released Wednesday by the Labor Department.In the week ending Nov. 20, there were 199,000 initial applications for unemployment insurance, according to the seasonally adjusted figures, a decline of 71,000 from the previous week. Claims fell to the lowest level since November 1969 and are now well below the pre-pandemic trough of 225,000 applications received the week of March 14, 2020.The steep drop in unemployment applications comes after several strong months of job growth and rising consumer spending heading into the holiday shopping season. While high inflation has stressed many household budgets, U.S. job growth, economic production, stock values and corporate profits have all steamed ahead.The caveat: The steep drop was likely due to the Labor Department expecting far more seasonal layoffs than the country experienced last month, one of several ways the pandemic has skewed economic data. But even if claims rebound toward normal levels next week, it will mark a strong improvement.BIDEN'S BUDGET PICKBiden taps Shalanda Young to lead White House budget officePresident Biden on Wednesday announced his plans to nominate Shalanda Young as director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) after the longtime Capitol Hill aide spent months serving as acting director.If confirmed, Young would be the first Black woman to run the agency. She has served as acting director since Neera Tanden's nomination for OMB director was withdrawn in March.Biden also announced his intent to nominate Nani Coloretti as deputy director of the OMB. Coloretti would become one of the highest ranking Asian American or Pacific Islanders in the administration if confirmed.The OMB has been without Senate-confirmed leadership for the entirety of the Biden administration thus far after Tanden withdrew her nomination in the face of bipartisan opposition.The agency is responsible for overseeing the formulation and implementation of the federal government's budget. Biden referred to it in Wednesday's video as the ""nerve center"" of the government.Brett Samuels has more here.SHOPPING SPREEIncomes, consumer spending rose in October even as inflation spikedConsumer spending rose in October despite a surge of inflation as higher personal incomes helped buffet rising prices, according to data released Wednesday by the Commerce Department.Personal consumption expenditures rose 1.3 percent last month, powered by a 1 percent increase in spending on goods and a 0.7 percent rise in spending on services. Consumer spending on goods has run far ahead of services due to a combination of supply chain snarls, coronavirus-related restrictions and changes in consumption habits driven by the pandemic.The PCE index rose 0.6 percent in October after three straight months of 0.4 percent increases in consumer prices. The index also rose 5 percent during the year leading into October - a 0.6 percentage point increase in the annual inflation rate from September.I break it down here. Good to KnowFederal Reserve officials debated this month whether the bank should be prepared to taper asset purchases and raise interest rates quicker than they once expected as inflation spiked, according to minutes released Wednesday.Here's what else we have our eye on:A majority of registered voters blame President Biden and Congress for the global supply chain and delivery issues affecting Americans, according to a new poll.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday apologized after he made what he called ""a joke"" saying the bank would outlast the Chinese Communist Party.That's it for today.

45,45.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/former-oilfield-drillers-see-energy-162750759.html,Former Oilfield Drillers See Energy Sector and Bitcoin Mining Joining Forces,"Drilling for oil and gas and mining for bitcoin might seem like an odd couple.One is more than 150 years old. The other has existed for a little over a decade. One is a staple of industrial development, squarely grounded in the world of atoms. The other is an innovation of a digital era, financial plumbing for the world of bits. One involves sweaty outdoor work. The other involves a lot of math and abstraction inside cavernous air-conditioned data centers.If the founders of bitcoin miner JAI Energy are right, the two industries are an ideal match.Based in Casper, Wyo., (population: 58,446), these oil-and-gas veterans are on a mission to leave no energy stranded. Their thesis is that miners and drillers can solve each other’s problems: The crypto miners get a cheap source of electricity for their power-guzzling computers; the drillers can diversify their revenue sources and not have to waste vast amounts of excess energy produced at their current operations.“Every oil and gas company in five-10 years from now will have some exposure to mining bitcoin,” Ryan Leachman, a founding partner of JAI, said in a recent interview with CoinDesk.Read more: How Bitcoin Mining WorksDrilling and producing oil and gas has been plagued by a lack of infrastructure to transport the fossil fuels. After drilling in Wyoming and encountering that obstacle, Leachman and fellow JAI founding partner Justin Ballard turned to bitcoin mining to reduce so-called flaring of natural gas, as state regulations would have otherwise required them to close their drilled oil and gas well.Flaring natural gasFlaring of natural gas, where the excess gas is burned if encountered while drilling for fossil fuels, has become a standard industry practice because of the lack of transportation infrastructure. The process is under environmental scrutiny and U.S. President Joe Biden has pledged to cut methane emissions from oil and gas operations, at a time when investors are increasingly prioritizing climate-friendly companies in their portfolios.Story continuesA scenario of net-zero emissions by 2050 requires all non-emergency flaring to be eliminated globally by 2030, resulting in a 90% reduction in flared volumes by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).JAI’s “digital flare mitigation,” or using flared gas to power bitcoin mining, could be one way to help address the environmental concerns regarding the burning of natural gas.To reduce the amount of gas burned, Leachman and Ballard in 2019 switched gears to form a bitcoin mining operation where they capture the flared gas, convert it to electricity and use it to power mining rigs. At its 12-acre mining farm in Wyoming, JAI mines bitcoin for itself and hosts machines for energy companies that may want to mine for bitcoin using excess flared gas. JAI also provides products and services for companies to capture their excess energy.Read more: Bitcoin Mining Is Reshaping the Energy Sector and No One Is Talking About ItNow, Leachman and Ballard are expanding to Texas. The Lone Star State offers competitive rates for power, and JAI’s founders know the state well from their oil and gas days. One of JAI’s larger-scale projects in Texas will be “on-grid” as opposed to off-grid, meaning they will be drawing power from the electrical grid rather than from sources such as excess natural gas or solar power.“Ultimately, we are trying to set ourselves up with sites that have the lowest power costs with an ability to continue to scale and grow our company,” Leachman said.Bitcoin energy use in TexasTexas has been at the forefront of grid and power concerns after the state experienced harsh winter storms earlier this year that prompted electrical outages. Even some bitcoin miners had to go offline. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz spoke at a blockchain summit in Austin last month, where he touted the benefits of having bitcoin miners on the grid as a source of interruptible load.Bitcoin miners can aid “demand response” programs, which refers to formal or informal agreements to curtail demand when the grid is overtaxed and prices are high, CoinDesk reported last month following the summit. Bitcoin miners can also adjust their consumption to a level demanded by a grid operator during certain periods. Critics argue that merely adding new demand to the grid won’t solve Texas’ power problems.However, Crusoe Energy, which is another firm that provides digital flare mitigation systems, thinks that bitcoin miners, renewable energy providers and grid operators have a chance to coexist, highlighting one of the company’s upcoming Texas projects that has connections to local power grids.“In this setup, what we’re able to provide the renewable power generation company is a curtailable load resource,” CEO Chase Lochmiller told CoinDesk in an interview. “So we can actually curtail the draw of our machines during moments of peak power demand, and then we can consume all of the power during off-peak demand.”He added that Crusoe has the ability to be the “buyer of last resort” when energy generated by renewable sources of energy isn’t being fully consumed and expects companies such as his to be “a mechanism to incentivize more renewable energy development.”Bitcoin mining and ESG concernsBitcoin’s massive energy consumption has created concerns about its impact on the environment. Even though some industry executives have pushed back against the narrative that bitcoin mining is bad for the environment, many miners including Atlas Mining, CleanSpark and Stronghold Digital Mining are all using more sustainable sources of power for their operations.A survey by the Bitcoin Mining Council, an industry forum, found that sustainable power has grown to about 58% of the total used by the industry worldwide during the third quarter from 3% in the second quarter. The increase is partly due to the rapid expansion of North American mining amid the exodus from China, and miners rotating toward more sustainable energy and modern mining techniques.Traditional oil and gas companies may benefit financially from mining bitcoin, though that situation could continue to provide incentives for fossil fuel production, according to Matthew Schultz, chairman of bitcoin miner CleanSpark. Schultz said he isn’t convinced that large energy producers will take a bitcoin mining route, in light of ESG (environmental, social and governance) questions.Read more: What Is Proof-of-Work?Energy firms might think, “‘We’re already flaring the gas, why not make something out of it?’ I think that that’s an easy conclusion,” Schultz said in an interview with CoinDesk. However, if the flared gas becomes economically beneficial for an oil and gas company, it would become more likely to drill another well that’s going to have stranded gas, which would harm the environment further, he cautioned.CleanSpark says it runs its operations with over 90% of carbon-neutral energy sourced primarily from nuclear, hydroelectric, solar and other renewable sources of energy.Environmental critics might push for oil and gas producers to cap their wells altogether, versus opting to mine bitcoin with the excess gas; most flaring, however, occurs where natural gas is produced as a byproduct from oil drilling and where non-fossil fuel energy isn’t reliable enough yet to meet global energy needs. Cleaning up the wasted energy and engaging in flare mitigation is a better means to lowering emissions versus capping energy production, Crusoe’s Lochmiller said. The company lists Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Devon Energy as a customer that has pledged to reach flaring intensity of 0.5% or lower by 2025, and eliminate routine flaring by 2030.Global oil demand fell nearly 7% in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and flaring fell by only 5%, the IEA notes. Globally, 142 billion cubic meters of natural gas was flared in 2020 – roughly equivalent to the natural gas demand of Central and South America. That amount of flaring resulted in about 265 metric tons of carbon dioxide, nearly 8 metric tons of methane (240 metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent) and black soot, along with other greenhouse gases being directly emitted into the atmosphere.“To reduce flaring, productive uses for the associated gas must be developed, or associated gas must be safely injected into the reservoir,” according to the IEA, adding in its flaring outlook that “one solution is to channel associated gas into the main gas grid to meet local demand or to be exported.”Scalability of bitcoin miningDespite superficial differences, fundamentally there are many aspects of bitcoin mining that an energy producer will find familiar, according to Leachman. “One of the similarities is that the low-cost providers, or the low-cost operators, are going to be the ones that will have the staying power,’’ he said.For a bitcoin miner, access to cheap power is essential to stay competitive. If natural gas that was going to waste can be turned into power for mining, electricity would be essentially free for the energy company’s mining operations, while adding a revenue stream.Oil and gas producers, along with providers of infrastructure, like pipelines, “really have the potential to have a very asymmetrical risk profile to bitcoin mining,” Leachman said.These energy companies already have a sustainable business, and if they dedicate a portion of their capital to bitcoin mining, it can almost act like a hedge for their main revenue stream during a down cycle for commodities, he explained. An additional aspect of bitcoin mining that’s attractive compared to oil and gas production is that crypto mining is “completely scalable,” Leachman said.Energy producers face hurdles in ramping up production, whereas bitcoin miners can generate revenue quicker once they are up and running and eventually are able to increase the scale of their operations at a faster rate.Digital storage for natural gasTo be clear: Leachman isn’t saying all oil and gas companies will completely pivot to bitcoin mining.“My recommendation for oil and gas companies wouldn’t be to necessarily have the goal to become the biggest bitcoin miner,” but rather to treat bitcoin mining as a secondary business that supplements their core business, he said.Another part of Leachman’s pitch for bitcoin mining exposure is that it can act as digital storage, in a sense, for an energy company’s natural gas and provide better returns during periods of volatile commodity price fluctuations in traditional gas production.Energy companies can convert their gases to bitcoin, hold the cryptocurrency digitally and participate in the upside as bitcoin prices appreciate in the future, he said.By using the excess energy to mine bitcoin, “there is a chance that the small percentage that you dedicated to bitcoin mining could be worth significantly more than the gas that you traditionally would sell down the line,” he said.Utility companies as bitcoin minersBeyond oil and gas operations, utility companies can also explore bitcoin mining given their experience with power grids and storing energy, Leachman said.Julien Dumoulin-Smith, a Bank of America research analyst, said in a note to clients that shared with CoinDesk that “unregulated independent power producers (IPPs) have the greatest opportunity to partner with miners and we have already seen agreements announced.”Dumoulin-Smith highlighted utility Black Hills Corp. as the perfect example of such a business model. The company “appears to have the most exposure because of its Wyoming footprint and innovative Block Chain Interruptible Service (BCIS) tariff,” the Bank of America note said. Black Hills developed the BCIS to meet energy needs of cryptocurrency miners, including fixed cost per kilowatt-hour rates, and negotiated prices that remain fixed for a period of two to three years.Another source of allure for companies in energy or other unrelated industries is that profit margins for bitcoin miners are now as high as 90%.","November 22, 2021, 8:27 AM"

The DeFi market is still largely unregulated and has gained the reputation as the Wild West of crypto. A new research report by crypto risk management firm Elliptic illustrates some of the pitfalls associated with the market.Losses stemming from DeFi-related fraud and theft total $10.5 billion year-to-date. This amount is up an eye-popping 600% vs. 2020 levels of $1.5 billion. Last year, DeFi ended the year with $21.1 billion in TVL, according to DeFi Llama.In a more top level view, DeFi market participants lost slightly more than $12 billion so far this year overall due to “the malicious exploitation of flaws” across Dapps including “decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols and asset management offerings,” according to the announcement.Elliptic Chief Scientist Tom Robinson stated,“The DeFi ecosystem is an incredibly exciting and fast-moving space, with financial services innovation happening at light speed. This is attracting large amounts of capital to projects that are not always robust or well-tested. Criminal actors have seen the opportunity to exploit this.”DeFi CulpritsAccording to the report, the culprits have been flaws in Dapps, giving nefarious actors the opportunity to exploit bugs. While decentralized apps are designed to be trustless and not require the intervention of any centralized third party, this does little good when the code has vulnerabilities.Flawed Dapps represented $10.8 billion of the loss tally. In addition, rug pulls, or exit scams, have also been on the rise in DeFi and have tacked on another $1 billion to this year’s losses.Burgeoning MarketDespite the risks, DeFi continues to attract top-tier developers and high-net-worth investors. DeFi has already disrupted the traditional financial system, giving market participants the opportunity to generate returns from activities such as lending and borrowing, staking and yield farming.Story continuesThe Bitwise management team forecasts that DeFi has only scratched the surface. They say DeFi could balloon into a $15 trillion segment in the next five-15 years if it follows in the footsteps of other disruptive technologies in which the Teslas and Amazons of the world operate.Ethereum, which is the most popular platform for DeFi projects, currently boasts $172.5 billion in TVL and rising. The Ethereum price has been on a tear in 2021 alongside the rise of DeFi.The Ethereum blockchain is home to popular DeFi projects such as MakerDAO for crypto lending and borrowing, exchange liquidity pool Curve Finance, and Compound, to name a few.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Dogecoin (DOGE) Attempts To Sustain Buying Interest Above $0.22TIME Magazine Adds ETH To Its Balance Sheet, Joins MetaverseNFL’s OBJ Joins Growing List of Players to Be Paid in BitcoinNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Slip on Warm Weather ForecastUSD/CAD Daily Forecast – Test Of Resistance At 1.2675S&P 500 Price Forecast – S&P 500 Reaches All-Time Highs","November 22, 2021, 8:51 AM"

As such, the concept of prime brokerage in traditional finance – a bundle of services often offered by investment banks that includes lending, cash management and netting – is gradually being replicated in the cryptocurrency world.Algorand buildersFounded by the Rand Labs team that built Algorand staples My Algo Wallet and AlgoExplorer, C3 is focused on creating a new layer for using collateral and margin across different blockchains, starting out by connecting collateral management Algorand and Ethereum, with the same cross-chain functionality also coming to Algrand and Solana.“The way Ethereum DeFi was built, every team tackled a separate vertical such as lending and borrowing, perpetuals or DEXs [decentralized exchanges],” C3 founder Michel Dahdah said in an interview. “But having all these different financial products isolated in terms of how they manage collateral makes it impossible for them to cross margin, meaning the collateral you’re using to borrow money for shorting, for example, can’t be used to also open a long position in a perpetuals financial product.”C3 will operate a “global clearing engine,” Dahdah said, so that users can lock collateral in one place and use it across a range of positions, in the same way that prime brokers act as a hub for collateral management in traditional finance.“C3 is an ambitious idea.

However, under the firebrand leadership of controversial Jair Bolsonaro, cryptocurrency adoption has slowed with the president infamously declaring “I don’t know what Bitcoin is”.But, as in many other environments worldwide, the decentralised revolution is grassroots in nature and adoption is fuelled not by the permissions of policymakers but by the everyday people that choose to use it.And one thing is crystal clear – Brazilians are choosing Bitcoin.It is estimated that 5% of Brazil’s entire population now own cryptocurrency – in excess of 10 million people.This impressive figure allows Brazil to boast the fifth-biggest crypto community in the world, with demographic research showing that holders are largely male and under the age of 40.Bitcoin popularity in Brazil driving adoptionHowever, not all of the state machinery is asleep – BACEN and Banco do Brasil are awake to the revolution in their doorstep.Despite the dismissive stance of Bolsonaro, the Central Bank of Brazil (BACEN) officially recognised Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as monetary assets in 2019, and Banco do Brasil became the first state bank in the world to enable consumer exposure to Bitcoin through ETF products – a huge move for the industry earlier this year.The mass adoption and excitement around Bitcoin since the onset of the 2021 bull run has now landed cryptocurrencies firmly on the desks on Brazil’s legislators – with a legislative bill underway that aims to give Bitcoin full legal tender status, similar to El Salvador.Story continuesThere was also the recent passage of amendments that brought in stricter punishments for crypto fraudsters and cyber criminals.Brazil’s crypto economy is also benefiting from the Bitcoin boom – the Brazilian-based Mercado Bitcoin, has succeeded in raising $200m in its recent Series B funding round.This investment in Mercado Bitcoin made 2TM (Mercado’s parent company) the eighth most valuable ‘unicorn’ company in South America.Read more: Brazil sports betting market to be worth $1.6bn annually.","November 22, 2021, 9:08 AM"

I think they're right. But I'm not betting the farm on it.I was an internet-stock analyst during the dot-com bubble two decades ago, so I have some firsthand experience with financial bubbles. I've summarized the experience here, along with my subsequent run-in with the SEC.In a future article, I'll explain why I'm in the bubble camp. But here, I'll just share three things I learned last time that explain why I'm not going all-in in either direction this time around.1. No one knows what will happen, including your favorite market gurus.Back in the 1990s, I got to know some of the most sophisticated professional investors in the world. As I talked with them, and learned from them, I realized that one of my long-held assumptions about Wall Street was wrong.I had assumed that, somewhere, there were some investors who were so smart and well-informed that they knew what was going to happen.Instead, I learned that no one knows what is going to happen.Some investors' guesses are more sophisticated and better informed and reasoned than others, but they're still guesses. No one actually knows.Why does this matter?It matters because it's important to remind yourself that your favorite market gurus don't know what will happen. Not George Soros. Not Warren Buffett. Not Ray Dalio. Not your crypto-zealot buddy or your trusted financial advisor. So don't put too much stock in what anyone says or thinks will happen. They don't know.2. It's really hard to ""call the top.""It's always tempting to think you can ride the market up, ""call the top,"" and then get out before the crash.Story continuesAlas, this is harder than it looks.(Also, unless you never plan to invest again, you have to also correctly ""call the bottom,"" so you can get back in. And you have to pay taxes on any gains you accrued on the way up. So to make it worth selling out, you have to get the timing right twice and make more than the 25%-to-50% tax hit on your gains. That's hard.)From 1995 to 2000, I thought what was happening with tech and internet stocks might be a bubble, and I was on the lookout for ""the top.""The problem is that, except in hindsight, it's hard to tell the difference between ""a dip"" and ""the top.""From 1995 to 1999, everything that looked like it might be ""the top"" — including a big, scary ""dip"" in the fall of 1998 — proved to be just another ""buying opportunity.""By early 2000, things had been crazy for years, and, despite the occasional dip, they had just kept getting crazier. So even in March 2000, when the Nasdaq fell by a third in three weeks, most of us didn't know we had passed ""the top.""The market rallied that summer. By fall, we were almost back to the previous highs. It wasn't until then that the bottom fell out.In hindsight, the cause of the top was obvious: The source of cash that had accelerated spending on all manner of tech and internet products for years — wide-open IPO and debt markets that allowed anyone who wanted money to raise as much as they wanted — disappeared. And the spending disappeared with it.Unfortunately, to most of us, this was only obvious in hindsight.(You may think I only missed the top in 2000 because I'm an idiot. That may be so, but please read this excellent WSJ article by Greg Zuckerman describing how one of the smartest investors in history, Stan Druckenmiller, also missed it. Druckenmiller is not an idiot.)3. It's almost as painful to miss out on crazy gains as it is to lose your shirt. (Almost.)One thing everyone forgets after a bubble bursts is how painful it is to miss out when everything is going up.It's really painful.Just ask anyone who sold Tesla five years ago. Or who never bought bitcoin. Or who jettisoned everything in the depths of the Great Financial Crisis. Or who got spooked during last year's COVID crash and missed the extraordinary rally since.Almost nothing hurts more than that.Almost nothing... except one thing:Losing your shirt when the bubble bursts.That REALLY hurts.So how do I invest my own money when I think it's a bubble but I know I don't know; when I don't think I can ""call the top and then call the bottom""; and when it hurts almost as much to miss out on gains as to lose my shirt?I stay diversified.Unlike professional investors, my job doesn't depend on my outperforming competitors every week. This gives me the flexibility to avoid betting money on things I don't know and can't control.If the market is a bubble, I'll take it on the chin. But I'll live to fight another day.If it's not a bubble and it just keeps soaring higher, I'll make less than those who bet the ranch, but I won't miss out completely.This approach may sound boring, unambitious, and wimpy. But if you like to sleep well — and not waste time worrying about things you don't know and can't control — I recommend it.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 22, 2021, 9:22 AM"

""Invest here and earn all the money you want,"" he told the euphoric crowd.Supporters have hailed Bukele's plans - including making bitcoin legal tender in September - saying they would bring jobs, financial inclusion and foreign investment to one of the Western Hemisphere's poorest countries.""Feel the Bit"" read the giant screen before Bukele - who brands himself ""CEO of El Salvador"" on Twitter - came on stage.But some in El Salvador and beyond expressed outrage at the glitzy event in a nation beleaguered by inequality, violence and poor public services.""This video makes me sick, angry and sad at the same time,"" said Marce, twitter user @_lamismadeayer.The government says the issuance of $1 billion in ""Volcano bonds"" in partnership with Blockstream - a digital assets infrastructure company - would provide development funds. El Salvador currently faces a $500 million budget gap for next year according to credit rating agency Fitch.But the bitcoin bond is not designed to cover that gap.Half of the bond money would go to infrastructure, including for building Bitcoin City, with the remainder used to purchase bitcoin and locked up for five years. After the lock up, the bitcoin can be sold, generating a capital return that will be split 50-50 between the government and investors, only after the initial $500 million are recouped, according to the plan.Story continuesThe 10-year bitcoin bond offers a 6.5% coupon, payable yearly, but another Salvadoran bond that matures in 2032 is currently yielding close to 13.9%.Financial markets have reacted warily. The spread of Salvadoran yields to safe-haven U.S. Treasuries has widened sharply since late April. This week it added an extra 79 basis points and sits above 1,200 bps, its widest ever.Investors sold off El Salvador's bonds in May after the Bukele-controlled Congress fired the attorney general and five Supreme Court judges, who were replaced with loyalists, critics say.The 2025 bond yields more than 18%, according to Refinitiv data. With such a high cost, the country is effectively excluded from borrowing on the market.Graham Stock, senior sovereign analyst at Blue Bat Asset Management, said government funding through bitcoin could discourage El Salvador from adopting sustainable spending policies, adding the country would likely continue to need International Monetary Fund support.""Building the economy around crypto mining and attracting crypto businesses is an untested strategy to put it mildly,"" he said, adding Bukele did not appear to have plans to increase growth and tax revenues. IMF TALKS STALLEDTalks with the IMF for a $1 billion loan have stalled amid concerns over a lack of transparency and the price volatility of cryptocurrency, as well as fears of democratic backsliding as Bukele consolidates power. But many in the cryptocurrency community are upbeat, saying the bond will harness strong retail demand.""Bitcoin bonds are a game-changer in fixed income markets,” said Moritz Wietersheim, founder of Specter Solutions, a bitcoin security and product company.Although bitcoin has fallen about 16% from its record high of $68,990.90 this month, it remains up over 90% this year.""Bitcoin Week"" marked the first time the digital currency experiment was stress-tested by international crypto evangelists.As vendors hawked ""Jesus Loves Bitcoin"" shirts, panel discussions grouped crypto currency leaders and Salvadoran ministers. Excitement was widespread at having a 'petri dish', as many attendees called El Salvador’s experiment.Several attendees aired worries about the government's Chivo wallet, where Salvadorans can send and receive bitcoin - highlighting tensions over a state tool for a currency created as an alternative to government financial systems.Pre-loaded with $30 for users and backed by a $150 million fund, Chivo allows users to make transactions to other Chivo users fee-free, but registration requires Salvadorans to enter their ID numbers and other personal information while transactions are kept on a ledger.Some attendees described Chivo as a gateway to independent bitcoin wallets, such as Muun or BlueWallet, that offer privacy.""When I make a payment, in the notes section, I write ‘use Muun, don’t use Chivo,’"" said Wietersheim, using the hashtag #FixChivo on Twitter.Since its rollout, Chivo has been criticized for thousands of cases of fraud and money disappearing from wallets.Several programmers said that for the speed of implementation - less than four months after Bukele announced it at a June conference - these technical problems were normal.Bukele has blamed high demand for the issues.

54,54.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/junk-rated-el-salvador-bitcoin-174520282.html,Junk-Rated El Salvador’s ‘Bitcoin Bonds’ Look Explosive (Think Volcano),"While El Salvador’s new bitcoin-linked bond may be one of the highest-yielding fixed-income instruments globally, it might turn out to be riskier than the country’s outstanding government bonds, which are already categorized as junk-grade.Some experts said the new offering might struggle to attract investors, especially since the bond appears to pay interest at a lower rate than the country’s conventional dollar-denominated bonds.El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele announced the plans on Saturday to issue a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” with a 10-year maturity on the Liquid Network. Half of the money raised will be used to purchase bitcoin, and the rest will fund construction of a new ”Bitcoin City,” along the Gulf of Fonseca near a volcano.The bond – developed by Blockstream and processed by Bitfinex – will offer a 6.5% coupon, or the rate of annual interest payments. In addition, investors will receive dividends generated by staggered liquidation of bitcoin holdings, which will begin from the sixth year. The annualized yield back to investors could reach 146% in the 10th year, according to Blockstream projections.Compare that with the benchmark 10-year yield on El Salvador’s outstanding government bonds, currently around 13%, according to Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International (ADMISI).For further context, the U.S. 10-year Treasury, considered by many global authorities and bond investors to have pristine creditworthiness, yields about 1.5%.Will the bitcoin price go to $1 million?But the new El Salvador bond’s projected performance is based on Blockstream models suggesting that bitcoin will rally to $1 million in the next five years – an aggressive target given that the cryptocurrency is currently trading around $58,000.Some investors might be betting that the lockup period – wherein $500 million of bitcoin would be out of circulation – might itself contribute to a fresh bull run.Story continues“Anyone buying this bitcoin-backed bond is betting on the cryptocurrency in a very big way, ignoring the credit market currently signaling that El Salvador is very much facing a distressed-debt situation,” Ostwald told CoinDesk in an email.Prices for the country’s outstanding government bonds due in 2032 traded above 110 cents on the dollar in April – well above the par value – and have been declining ever since. Recently, they were changing hands below 75 cents on the dollar, providing a very relevant example of just how volatile emerging-market bonds can be.El Salvador’s bonds considered junk-gradeCredit-rating firms have already cast the Central American country’s bitcoin foray as a negative.El Salvador adopted bitcoin as legal tender in June. A month later, Moody’s downgraded the country’s long-term, foreign-currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Caa1 from B3, citing the decision to adopt bitcoin as a sign of weak governance. Obligations rated Caa1 are judged to be junk grade – of poor standing and subject to very high credit risk.The latest announcement to issue bitcoin-backed bonds may draw further ire from rating agencies and international partners.“I suspect that El Salvador bonds are sufficiently risky, and adding bitcoin on top of that precludes most retail investors and more institutional investors,” Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, told CoinDesk in an email.Charlie Morris, CIO of ByteTree Asset Management, said issuing bonds linked to bitcoin could further isolate El Salvador.“That is dangerous because if the plan goes wrong, who will save the day?” Morris said, adding that Blockstream’s million-dollar forecast for bitcoin (BTC) is extremely optimistic.Are El Salvador’s bitcoin bonds a gimmick?According to Bannockburn’s Chandler, the country’s new bitcoin bonds appear to be a gimmick to achieve lower interest rates.Borrowing costs tend to be higher in indebted nations with weak economic growth like El Salvador, Greece, Sri Lanka, and Mozambique. Each of these nations offers a double-digit yield on their benchmark 10-year bond.However, by allocating half of the proceeds from the debt sale to bitcoin, the El Salvadorian government is giving investors a share of the cryptocurrency’s possible price upside. That might help explain why investors would be willing to buy the country’s new bitcoin bonds at a lower yield than what they would get from El Salvador’s conventional outstanding bonds.According to Chandler, “the desperate attempt” could work but would require getting lucky on bitcoin, whose intrinsic value, or lack thereof, continues to be debated. Chandler says that other countries should follow El Salvador’s lead but probably won’t.“I doubt that as I doubted many corporate treasurers would buy bitcoins as Tesla did,” he said.Would it be less risky to... just buy bitcoin?Crypto investors may also think twice before taking the gambit, since they likely already have experience buying bitcoin directly.“While crypto enthusiasts will doubtless be buyers, the simple question is would they rather own the underlying, or be happy to take the encumbrance of a clearly distressed sovereign debt, let alone any geological risk of ‘Bitcoin City’ being located next to a volcano,” ADMISI’s Ostwald said. “I guess that brings a whole new meaning to ‘explosive.’”Laurent Kssis, a crypto ETF expert and director of CEC Capital, said the bitcoin-backed bonds might be a good deal for investors who are already motivated to buy emerging market debt – government bonds of Russia, Mexico, India, Brazil and other less-developed nations. The benchmark bonds in these nations yield between 6% to 9%.However, for more risk-averse crypto traders, holding bitcoin might be a better option – as outlandish as that might sound to some investors used to lower volatility in traditional markets.“It is safer and may appreciate more than the bond,” Kssis said. “Bear in mind that the bond could/may default and may be classified as junk status so many investors may not be able to invest.”","November 22, 2021, 9:45 AM"

ADA crypto is now down over 29 cents in the past month, as of Nov. 21, when it was at $1.87 per token. That is a drop of 13.5%.Cardano (ADA) token with blue and orange digital background.Source: Stanslavs / ShutterstockMoreover, in the last 3 months, it peaked at $2.9634 on Sept. 1. This represents a tumble of over $1.09 per ADA crypto token or a loss of 36.9%.This is a much worse performance than other cryptos its size or larger. For example, Solana (CCC:SOL-USD), which is slightly larger, has risen 19.1% in the past month, not dropped like Cardano. Solana now has a market capitalization of $71 billion, but Cardano is at just $62.2 billion.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMoreover, by comparison, Solana is up 222% in the past three months, not down 37% like at Cardano. Ethereum (CCC:ETH-USD) is up over 10% in the last month, and in the last 3 months, it’s up over 35%. This puts Cardano’s 37% drop in the same period to shame.In fact, Binance Coin (CCC:BNB-USD), which has a $99 billion market cap, is up in both its one-month and 3-month performance. It’s up over 25.3% in the last month and up 30.6% in the last 3 months.7 Stocks to Sell You Can Feel Good About DumpingThe same is true for Bitcoin (CCC:BTC-USD). Although being down 5.3% in the last month, it’s still up 21.1% in the last 3 months, not down like Cardano.This Should Tell You SomethingSo Cardano is the odd man out. It should imply something significant. I have written about the issues with Cardano in several other articles.One of my concerns is that Cardano’s smart contract upgrade has not taken off that well. So far the Alonzo hard fork, or upgrade, has not yet shown to have brought in a good number of new apps.For example, developers have not yet taken up the Cardano script en masse, so to speak, to write smart contract apps in the Defi arena (decentralized finance). Nor is there a major NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace that has taken up a large market share with trading in NFTs.Story continuesIt’s not that I don’t think this will come sometime in the future. At least right now, Cardano’s smart contract upgrade capabilities have yet to catch on with new games, DeFi apps, NFTs, etc.And as I have shown the crypto simply does not have a large market share in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL). To put it bluntly, Cardano simply has no TVL market share, according to DefiLlama.com, which doesn’t even rank Cardano-based apps.What this tells me, along with the drop in ADA crypto price, is that Cardano is on its backfoot. It needs to book a major win, a major app or sponsor, company or personality backing its ongoing development.What to Do With ADA CryptoAt this point, despite being near a trough, it might make sense for value crypto buyers to wait out the weakness in the price. It’s always possible this extra volatility — compared to other cryptos its size — is indicative of another leg down.The torrent of bearish sentiment sometimes feeds on itself. For example, it’s hard to get people to believe in a turnaround without any major news. In fact, when the Alonzo hard fork came out in September, Decrypt magazine quoted a number of critics on Cardano. Some of them “cast doubt on whether Cardano’s smart contract models are up to the task.” The article mentioned that Cardano’s script needs a number of “workarounds.”I suspect that most investors will hold off putting new money into ADA crypto until Cardano smart contracts start to win big support. That seems like a winning formula in the cryptocurrency arena, which has many cryptos spending large amounts on marketing and technology. So far I don’t see that happening with Cardano.On the date of publication, Mark R. Hake did not hold any position, directly or indirectly, in any security mentioned in this article.

In fact, early in March, TIME released an exclusive series of three TIME covers as NFTs at auction, which featured iconic covers through its tenure and also a special design for the purpose.Expanding Crypto Offering Soon?About the metaverse’s category, TIME will run the campaign through December 31, while the weekly newsletter will last indefinitely. The maneuver is another milestone for the company in terms of crypto adoption, given that the partnership with Galaxy Digital is a big one.The crypto firm is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as GLXY and specializes in portfolio management, capital markets, and blockchain technology. It also has offices in several major cities like New York, Tokyo, Amsterdam, London, among others.It’s unknown whether the media outlet expects to expand its metaverse section into other crypto-related fronts or not, nor will it diversify the crypto offering among its subscribersHowever, TIME is setting precedents in the US mainstream media as a crypto-friendly outlet that paves the ground for others to become familiar with an industry that gathers more adopters from an institutional level each day.

A recent rally shot shiba inu to the 11th spot among the world's most valuable cryptocurrencies, a position that has since slipped slightly, to 12th place, according to CoinGecko.Dogecoin came in second on the list of price increases at 9,567% growth this year.""Envisaged as being a light-hearted and fun cryptocurrency to poke fun at the emerging world of crypto, [dogecoin] ended up building its own community and taking off in a huge way, particularly after being frequently mentioned by Elon Musk on social media,"" said BrokerChooser, noting the Tesla boss has said dogecoin is part of his personal portfolio.Story continuesBehind dogecoin was Terra, which trades as LUNA, with its price jump of 6,496% to $31.66 in September. The token, developed by South Korean firm Terraform Labs, is used for governance and staking on a decentralized financial payment network that powers a basket of stablecoins for cross-border transactions.Terra's price ""exploded"" in January when it raised $25 million in a funding round from Galaxy Digital, Coinbase Ventures, Pantera Capital, and others, said BrokerChooser.Shiba Inu led in the number of searches, with ""Shiba Inu coin"" soaring to 1.5 million searches from 70. Searches began to increase despite the coin's ""incredibly low"" price of $0.0000000003 in September 2020 that eventually drove up to $0.0000072 a year later. ""[If] you had invested just $10 in the currency in September 2020 you'd have over $200,000 just 12 months down the line,"" said BrokerChooser.Rounding out the top three in popularity terms, polygon searches surged by 100,456% to 90,500, followed by Terra, up 5,556% to 18,100. Polygon, formally known as Matic, is designed to scale ethereum chains and develop the blockchain's infrastructure.Polygon was the fourth-biggest price gainer, up 4,800% to $1.47.

65,65.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-mining-in-navajo-land-yields-jobs-revenues-while-revealing-economic-disparity-195141438.html,"Bitcoin mining in Navajo land yields jobs, revenues while revealing economic disparity","Tiffany Nelson knew little about cryptocurrency when she first happened upon a temporary labor job in 2019. A Canada-based company called Westblock was recruiting “labor hands,” in Nelson’s words, to help unload boxes in a data center facility on land belonging to the Navajo Nation.A Navajo living on tribe land, Nelson considered the job rare for its proximity to her home. With a total tribe population of 400,000 people, only about 170,000 live on the reservation. That’s most often attributed to poor economic conditions and scarce employment opportunities, especially for women.While grateful for the opportunity, Nelson’s employer didn’t initially tell her what the company’s business on the New Mexico reservation was.Another Navajo woman, Kennette Phillips, who was hired around the same time, recalled similar misgivings surrounding the mysterious business of her employer.As security guards kept watch over the site, Phillips, Nelson and another employee unloaded boxes and then began setting up the machines inside.“When we opened the boxes, we found these machines that looked like toasters,” Phillips recalled. “We weren’t told what they were for. It seemed a little sketchy… we didn’t know if what we were doing was legal.”Tiffany Nelson (Photo courtesy of Compass Mining)Part of their growing concern was spurred by the crisis-level rates indigenous women have been kidnapped or murdered across Canada and the U.S. When the two women, both single mothers, finally asked their employer what the site would be used for, they discovered with much relief, the company intended to use the toaster-like machines to mine bitcoin.Bitcoin mining is the computationally-heavy process of computers validating bitcoin’s network of transactions. While the cryptocurrency’s supply is limited at 21 million coins, it distributes a small sliver of that supply to miners for contributing computer power, thereby securing the network.The work can be lucrative, especially as the price has more than tripled over the last year. Mining bitcoin requires specialized computers, the infrastructure to house them, plus a robust and stable power supply.Story continues“Oh, wow. Okay,” Nelson remembered thinking with relief. She didn’t claim to understand the full extent of how bitcoin worked back then, but she knew it was a cryptocurrency, “like internet money.”Three years later, Nelson and Phillips manage operations for the site full-time. In addition to two other full-time managers who together keep the operation running day and night, the facility also employs four to six security guards to protect their expensive mining equipment, which is valued in the tens of millions of dollars, according to WestBlock’s CEO Ken MacLean.Tapping into unused power sourcesLike many other bitcoin mining operations, this project benefits from tapping into energy that otherwise went unused. After the shutdown of a nearby coal-fired power plant, the Navajo Tribal Utility Authority (NTUA), a tribe-owned nonprofit, possessed an extra 15-megawatt load of electricity for which they were eating the cost.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.According to WestBlock’s MacLean, the power the operation draws from NTUA comes from a mix of solar, hydroelectric, nuclear power and natural gas, with 60% of it attributed to renewable energy. The situation reflects the Navajo Nation’s broader and economically difficult energy transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources over the last decade.Historically, the bulk of the tribe’s revenues have come from leasing land to extractive energy companies, with leases for oil and gas mining operations accounting for 51% of the tribe’s total income as far back as 2003.Critics of bitcoin mining’s high energy consumption are quick to point out that bitcoin now accounts for 1% of the planet’s energy consumption. While direct comparison can be tricky, the computational power directed toward securing bitcoin consumes more power than all the refrigerators in the U.S. but less than the total energy used to produce paper and pulp worldwide, according to the University of Cambridge’s Center for Alternative Finance. Additionally, WestBlock’s bitcoin mining project currently uses 7 megawatts of the NTUA’s power with plans to eventually use all 15 megawatts in the near future. Relative to other regions within the Navajo Nation, the project’s energy consumption suggests some economic disparity.A three-hour drive west from the site, in the Nation’s Black Mesa region, many residents live without electricity and running water.Kennette Phillips (Photo courtesy of Compass Mining)Navajo Nation's need to diversify its economyBut the effort of transferring power from one part of the nation to another is not so simple, according to Carl Slater, a delegate with the Navajo Nation’s Tribal Council. Roughly the size of West Virginia, the Navajo Nation is the largest independent authority of land within the U.S. and its power grid isn't connected evenly dispersed or connected throughout its 17 million square acres.Surprised, to say the least, when he first heard a developer was mining bitcoin on Navajo land, Slater told Yahoo Finance the opportunity could be an economic boon for the nation, if the revenues paid to its utility can end up serving the nation's residents.“The utility that the nation owns would have just had to eat the cost of that power. To make use of it in a way that generates revenue back to the nation is good, but I think there’s a shared responsibility between the nation, utility and developer to figure out a process whereby more of the revenue can be directed to our local communities,” said Slater.Andrew Curley, an assistant professor of geography at the University of Arizona, said the Nation’s move to bitcoin mining is just the latest iteration of their long-standing need to diversify its economy.“The tribal leaders are trying to make the reservation a place where companies, outside of those in extractive industries, can do business and hire people,” said Curley, a Navajo Nation member himself, who lives off the reservation.A sociologist by training whose research focuses on the Navajo Nation's energy transition, Curley called the bitcoin mining project an “interesting prospect” but also acknowledged that the Nation's energy disparity is relative to different local communities. While some communities remain without power, he said the utility companies bare the brunt of the responsibility, explaining that overall, the Navajo Nation “by far under-consumes the amount of energy it produces.” When thinking of other economically struggling nations that have or are considering adopting cryptocurrency more broadly, such as El Salvador, Curley is quick to point out the obvious problem with making cryptocurrency play a larger rule in the Nation's economy.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.“There is an innate problem and challenge when asking poorer people to take riskier transfers of technology,” said Curly.Though WestBlock’s mining operation opened in 2020, this year marks the first time the project has gained a material profit. On the other hand, the tribal utility NTUA has yet to disclose its total revenue from the effort, but should in early 2022. In addition to monthly revenues for internet and electricity paid to the NTUA, WestBlock also pays taxes, rent for its land lease in addition to scholarships set aside for the local community.A person familiar with the Navajo-based operation said the revenue generated from the project this year is “in the millions,"" and that WestBlock is working with NTUA along with other tribal chapters to find other sites on the land, which might be used for bitcoin mining.“I’m just happy to have a job close to home, especially since so many people lost their jobs during the pandemic,” Tiffany Nelson added. “It's been a good ride and something that I’m proud to be a part of.”David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

Over the past five years, its payout has grown by 59%.So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Microsoft is the second-largest holding in O’Leary’s OUSA.Business has been booming of late, largely helped by the pandemic-fueled demand for its cloud-computing and video gaming offerings.In the most recent quarter, Microsoft's total revenue grew 22% to $45.3 billion while net income surged 48% to $20.5 billion.Year to date, Microsoft shares have returned a whopping 55%, easily topping other trillion-dollar tech giants like Apple (22%) and Amazon (13%).Of course, if you’re on the fence about jumping into tech stocks near all-time highs, some investing apps might give you a free share of Apple just for signing up.Johnson & JohnsonGolden Shrimp/ShutterstockWith deeply entrenched positions in consumer health, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices, Johnson & Johnson has been able to deliver remarkably consistent returns to investors through thick and thin.Not only does Johnson & Johnson post recurring profits year in and year out, but it grows them consistently, as well: Over the last 20 years, Johnson & Johnson’s adjusted earnings have increased at an average annual rate of 8%.That said, management is shaking things up to extract even more value for shareholders.The company recently announced plans to spin off its consumer health segment into a separate company in order to unlock value. Once the split is complete, investors will be given shares in both companies and, in turn, receive dividend payments from both stocks.With the spinoff looming and the shares currently offering a decent dividend yield of 2.6%, Johnson & Johnson looks like a particularly timely opportunity.The company is the third-largest holding in OUSA with a weighting of 4.7%.O’Leary’s other ‘fine’ assetGiorgiolo/ShutterstockGold, crypto, and common stocks aren’t the only things you’ll find in Mr. Wonderful’s portfolio.He also utilizes a ""private"" way to diversify and to profit.If you want to invest in something that has very little correlation with the violent swings of the stock and crypto market, consider this overlooked asset: fine art.Investing in art used to be an option only for the ultra-rich like O’Leary.

The cryptocurrency was trading at around $56,000 at press time and is down about 5% over the past 24 hours.Equities and cryptocurrencies initially ticked higher earlier during New York trading hours after U.S. President Joe Biden said he will renominate Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, following some speculation that Fed Governor Lael Brainard could replace Powell to lead the central bank for the next four years.For now, some analysts view the current pullback in cryptocurrencies as a normal occurrence after a strong rally over the past month.“With bitcoin and other crypto assets having reached fresh all-time highs, there was always likely to be a measure of profit-taking from investors, which then translates into price weakness,” Simon Peters, an analyst at eToro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.Latest PricesBitcoin (BTC): $55,898, -6.17%Ether (ETH): $4,065, -7.19%S&P 500: $4,682, -0.32%Gold: $1,804, -2.14%10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.62%As bitcoin buyers take some profits, equities appear to be holding up.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:Market moves: Bitcoin broke above $59,000 with at least one analyst expecting a “healthy” holiday rally.Technician’s take (Editor’s Note): On account of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, today’s First Mover Asia will include a column in place of the usual Technician’s take.Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.PricesBitcoin (BTC): $59,118 +3.5%Ether (ETH): $4,530 +6.4%Market movesThe crypto market on Thursday, the U.S. Thanksgiving day holiday, was not as quiet as some may have anticipated, after bitcoin prices briefly broke past $59,000, and trading volume remained at a level similar to the previous three days. Ether soared past $4,500, a more than 6% gain.Credit: CoinDesk/CryptoCompareAs bitcoin’s price finished Thursday (HKT/SGT) in the green, the rest of the crypto market experienced high price volatility with major winners of the day including gaming tokens GALA, SAND, and MANA and dog-themed meme token SHIB. These tokens all saw high daily trading volume on Thursday, a bullish sign for a token’s price when it accompanies a price rally.One analyst expects this bullish sentiment will continue during the December holiday season, particularly now that a few macroeconomic uncertainties have abated, including Jerome Powell’s reappointment as Federal Reserve chair.“The period after U.S. Thanksgiving is traditionally very bullish for risky assets and I would not be surprised to see a healthy Christmas rally for cryptos during the holiday season,” Changguang Zheng, co-founder and chief investment officer at crypto hedge fund ZX Squared Capital, told CoinDesk.Yet there were also less optimistic signs in investors’ activities. “Bitcoin put options, derivatives offering downside protection, continue to become pricier, implying bearish sentiment,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported on Thursday.OpinionEl Salvador: Who Needs the IMF When You Have Bitcoin?: The IMF is a brutal bully constantly declaring its virtue. It’s about time someone pushed back.Story continuesChristopher Nolan’s third Batman film, “The Dark Knight Rises,” is generally considered the weakest entry in the series, in part because it’s so easily read as a celebration of neoliberal authoritarianism. The film’s plot has the villain, Bane, take over Gotham City, wipe out all financial ledgers and reign over a kind of mega-Occupy movement. To fight back, Batman engages in a series of moral compromises that he justifies as, more or less, necessary exceptions to defend a more broadly just system.The International Monetary Fund has been playing the Batman role in the global order for decades. Though nominally aimed at supporting democracy and free markets, reforms mandated by the IMF in exchange for its loans have historically included serious cuts to social spending and industrial policy. The fallout is often devastating: The IMF’s (real world) body count is considerably higher than Batman’s.El Salvador, a country with low income and high debt, has been in negotiations with the IMF for one of its loans in the amount of $1.3 billion. One roadblock has been the country’s recent adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF signaled it wasn’t too happy with that idea.On Monday, El Salvador introduced a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” that could present at least a partial end-run around the IMF, highlighting why bitcoin made the IMF so queasy in the first place. “The Dark Knight Rises” contains a notorious moment, drawn from the Batman comics, in which Bane pummels Batman so badly that his back is broken, leaving him paralyzed and vulnerable. That’s about how the IMF is going to feel if El Salvador finds a way to raise large sums of international financing, as a developing country with a troubled economy, without the IMF or corruption-riddled global banks.The bond allows purchases in units of $100, using bitcoin or tether. It will be issued by Bitfinex, an essentially stateless and unregulated platform. So there are probably few if any controls on who can buy into this bond, either by source or by amount.That means one simple thing: El Salvador will absolutely sell out of this bond, and will probably be able to issue another round. It will replace that $1.3 billion from the IMF without breaking a sweat, even taking into account that about half of the first bond sale will go into a bitcoin fund.There doesn’t need to be any further explanation of this than “Bitcoiners are nuts and rich,” and would gladly pump money into this small country for the lulz. More seriously, every one of these experiments that pans out is another win for bitcoin, so pitching in is also a matter of enlightened self-interest. Remember that an Ethereum DAO just raised $40 million for what was essentially a vaguely civic-minded prank – $1 billion for an actual bond with an actual return is nothing.Let’s leave aside the touted “Bitcoin City” El Salvador says it wants to build using the other half of the first bond. That’s mostly a marketing stunt: For $500 million, at best the country will get a couple of power plants, a server farm and an IHOP. And that’s actually fine! Assuming El Salvador follows through in broad strokes, you do need some kind of infrastructure to support the mining facilities, so whether or not it’s a “city” right off the bat is a matter of semantics. And $500 million of new capital in the small country will have a major impact regardless of how it’s spent.So, kudos to El Salvador for burning down Wall Street and building a throne out of the skulls of predatory bankers. That said, the bond might not be a terribly great investment.For one thing, it introduces political counterparty risk to your bitcoin strategy. This is a country that only emerged from near-anarchy in 1994, and while President Nayib Bukele seems to have sturdy popularity, a disruptive change in leadership or the political order could mean creditors don’t get paid back. That’s not necessarily likely, but it’s on the table in a way that it’s not with, say, U.S. Treasury bonds (or just buying bitcoin yourself).Also, Blockstream’s projection that the bond will return 165% annually over 10 years is based on the bet that bitcoin will be trading at $1 million by that time. I consider that completely possible, but also completely unknowable. A 10-year projection for literally any asset is pretty much always going to be a made-up number. Invest accordingly – unless your real priority is to change the world.Important events8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT (12:30 a.m. UTC) Australia retail sales (Oct.

Here’s what’s happening this morning:Market moves: Bitcoin rallied in early trading on U.S. markets before dropping.Technician’s take: Short-term downside is likely into the Asia trading day.Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.PricesBitcoin (BTC): $56,452 -4.6%Ether (ETH): $4,107 -5.1%Market movesAfter picking up slightly earlier in the day, bitcoin continued its recent downward trend. At the time of publication, the cryptocurrency was trading above $56,500, down more than 4% over the past 24 hours. Ether followed a similar pattern, rallying before dropping to about $4,100.The cryptocurrencies and equities markets initially rose after the news that U.S. President Joe Biden had renominated Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for another four-year term as head of the country’s central bank. Speculation had been that Biden would reappoint Powell or choose Fed Governor Lael Brainard.Some market observers see bitcoin’s price support holding at $55,000.“The downward pressure on major crypto assets like bitcoin and ether is to be expected,” BitBull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “Bitcoin’s price increased more than 50% in the last 45 days to its all-time high. We expect the week to consolidate around $55K before rising again to $60K before the end of the month. We’ve repeatedly seen profit-taking in crypto when there are these quick run-ups.”DiPasquale added: “The news of Biden’s appointment of Powell is strong for crypto, as the U.S. has shown no signs of quantitative tightening; rather, just tapering the quantitative easing.”Technician’s takeBitcoin Struggled at $60K Resistance; Support Above $53KBitcoin four-hour price chart (Damanick Dantes/CoinDesk, TradingView)Bitcoin (BTC) buyers remained active over the weekend, although upside was limited around the $60,000 resistance level.The cryptocurrency continues to consolidate, with pullbacks limited toward $53,000 support.Intraday chart signals are neutral, suggesting the current loss of momentum could continue into the Asian trading session. Buyers will need to defend immediate support around $55,000 and decisively break above the short-term downtrend in order to yield further upside targets.Story continuesThe relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is approaching oversold levels, which could support a price recovery similar to what took place in late September.

WhaleAlert has recently reported a purchase of over 850 billion Shiba Inu coins, but this move also failed to provide material support to Shiba Inu.It looks that the interest in the coin is fading which is natural since Shiba Inu has been moving lower since late October, when it reached all-time high levels near $0.000090. Shiba Inu has already lost more than half of its value in less than one month, so traders’ interest in the coin is declining.Crypto markets are very dependent on momentum. According to CoinMarketCap, almost 15,000 cryptocurrencies exist in the world. While most cryptocurrencies are not available on major exchanges, traders still have plenty of options to choose from so they tend to move from one coin to another depending on the near-term trends.Not surprisingly, recent data from Google suggests that search interest in Shiba Inu coin is declining. Trends change quickly in the crypto world, and only the leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, managed to stay at the top of traders’ wishlists. The interest in other cryptocurrencies is often volatile, and they quickly move back and forth in rankings.At this point, it is obvious that Shiba Inu needs additional upside catalysts to break the current downside trend. Whale transactions failed to provide enough support to the cryptocurrency, and it needs to get back on the “hype train” to attract more traders.Technical AnalysisShiba Inu has recently made an attempt to settle above the resistance at the 50 EMA at $0.004245 but failed to develop sufficient upside momentum and moved back below the $0.000040 level. Currently, Shiba Inu is trying to settle below this level.Story continuesRSI remains in the moderate territory as Shiba Inu moves lower without huge sell-offs, so there is plenty of room to gain additional downside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.In case Shiba Inu manages to settle below the $0.000040 level, it will move towards the next support level which is located at the recent lows near $0.000036.A move below $0.000036 will push Shiba Inu towards the support at $0.000033, although it can also get some support near the $0.000035 level. If Shiba Inu declines below $0.000033, it will move towards the support at $0.000032.On the upside, a move above $0.000040 will push Shiba Inu towards the resistance at the 50 EMA. In case Shiba Inu manages to settle above the 50 EMA, it will head towards the next resistance level at $0.00004450. A successful test of this level will open the way to the test of the resistance at the 20 EMA near $0.000047.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Trying to RecoverGBP/USD Price Forecast – British Pound Continues to Look SickShiba Inu Keeps Moving Lower As Whale Transactions Fail To Provide Enough SupportBitcoin Price Prediction – Avoiding sub-$57,000 Would Bring $60,000 into PlaySAND Soars Over 260% In November While Metaverse is on FireStripe is Open to Accepting Crypto Payments Again","November 25, 2021, 1:20 AM"
77,77.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/next-shiba-inu-shib-retail-183152064.html,What Next for Shiba Inu (SHIB) as Retail Interest Ebbs?,"On the 28th of October, joke coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) hit a market capitalisation of above $54B. At the time, the price per coin reached an all-time high of just over $0.00008. That marked a near 2000% gain from the start of the month when the cryptocurrency’s price per coin was under $0.00001 and its market cap under $3.0B.The surge in Shiba Inu valuation went hand in hand with a rapid rise in retail interest in the coin. According to google trends, overall search interest in the term “Shiba Inu” surged by more than 30 times between the end of September and 27th of October. Similarly, over the same time period, Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric rose from under 20K to above 500K.Retail interest fadesBut as indicators of retail trader interest in the meme coin have faded in the subsequent weeks, SHIB’s price has gradually pulled back. According to google trends data, by the 23rd of November, overall search interest in “Shiba Inu” has dropped more than by 10 times compared to the record high on the 27th of October. Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric also pulled back to under 70K by the 23rd of November.Meanwhile, over the same time period, SHIB has come under pressure. The coin is now down over 50% from the late October record highs and trades just above $0.0004. That means its market cap has dropped to around $24B, according to TradingView.This is not the first time we have seen SHIB rise and fall in tandem with a rise and fall in retail investor interest in the meme coin. Recall back to May, when SHIB jumped from under $0.000002 to near $0.000035, a more than 20 fold increase in value, in a matter of days, before then sharply dipping back under $0.00001 (where it then stayed until October). That spike in valuation also coincided with a sharp uptick in search interest, according to google trends.What next for SHIB?Clearly then, if SHIB is to regain its mojo and head back to record levels, the retail trading/investing community is going to have to start getting excited about it again. Here the signs are tentatively promising. On Thursday the 25th of November, Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric lept back above 100K from close to 60K the day before. Similarly, in the last five days, their Social Engagement metric has risen from under 60K (a near-one-month low) to above 120K, a more than three-week high.Story continuesSHIB might be showing early signs of responding to this uptick in interest. The coin rose more than 20% in value on Thursday the 25th of November and is threatening a technical break above a downtrend that has suppressed the price action for the whole of November.Should SHIB break to the north of this level and should an acceleration in the coins gains rekindle retail trader/social media excitement about the coin, SHIB could be looking at some rapid gains back towards its prior record highs.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:S&P 500 Price Forecast – Futures Markets Quiet in Thin Holiday TradingNatural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Quiet During Holiday TradingGermany’s New Multi-party Government to Raise Investment but Maintain Fiscal DisciplineGold Price Forecast – Gold Markets Stable on ThanksgivingUSD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis – Convincing Breakout Over 115.615 Puts 118.601 – 118.658 on the RadarWTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+","November 25, 2021, 10:31 AM"

82,82.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kleiman-v-wright-craig-wright-035709970.html,Kleiman v. Wright: Craig Wright Takes Stand Again in Final Day of Testimony,"MIAMI – Testimony wrapped up Monday in the federal trial of Kleiman v. Wright, with Craig Wright – who has claimed to be the creator of Bitcoin and the person behind the name “Satoshi Nakamoto” – taking the witness stand a second time since the trial began three and a half weeks ago.His attorney, Andres Rivero, opened his line of questioning by asking, “Dr. Wright, did you form a business partnership with David Kleiman to invent and mine bitcoin?”“No,” Wright said bluntly.The trial pits Wright against the estate of his now-deceased friend Dave Kleiman. Kleiman’s surviving brother Ira claims that Dave helped Wright invent and mine bitcoin, that the two men had a business partnership and thus the estate is entitled to a portion of the bitcoin and intellectual property that allegedly resulted from that partnership. Testimony and evidence introduced during the trial focused on whether their relationship did or did not amount to a partnership.While Wright has claimed to be the pseudonymous inventor of Bitcoin since 2015, his claim has been met by skepticism by much of the Bitcoin community. Thus far, he has never been able to prove that he has control over the bitcoin keys or addresses associated with Satoshi Nakamoto. The potential ownership of those coins is at the center of the plaintiff’s civil suit against Wright.Read more: Kleiman v. Wright: Bitcoin’s Trial of the Century Kicks Off in MiamiMonday morning’s proceedings concluded the testimony of autism expert Dr. Ami Klin, who had begun testifying Friday. He said that Wright functions in social situations worse than 99% of the population and that “he gets very focused on the precise definition of words.”‘Electronic poker chip’Wright then took the stand, with Rivero leading him though an overview of his childhood and education. Wright said his parents split when he was five and he did not see his father after age 10. He was close to his maternal grandfather, who had been in the Australian air force and would build ham radios. He said his grandfather had a lot of Japanese memorabilia.Story continuesWright said he began coding computers when he was eight years old in 1979 and learned several coding languages. He said he earned multiple undergraduate and master’s degrees. He developed video games and did work for retailer Kmart and the Australian air force, then for gambling-related clients including MGM Grand and Lasseters Online Casino.In 2005, the U.S. government cracked down on the use of credit cards, checks and bank transfers to pay debts from illegal online gambling. Wright said he began developing the idea of a token system for online gaming that would get around problems with international money transfers.“A token is like an electronic poker chip,” Wright said.Lasseters’ online gambling operation closed in 2007. In the meantime, Wright said, he had been working with botnets, with the file-sharing service Limewire and with peer-to-peer networks. He wanted to share just how resilient such networks could be.“Rather than a single system, this was a distributed system so there were multiple nodes,” he said. It was more sustainable. If one company went broke, others could take over. “If one node goes down, it’s more profit for others. More profit attracts people,” he said.Wright said he started to formulate this idea in 2006 and it coalesced in 2007.Wright said he approached his then-boss at consulting firm BDO, Allan Granger, about collaborating on this. His legal team showed the court a document – notes from the meeting with Granger – with handwriting indicating that Wright would deliver a “doc” by October 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto posted the Bitcoin white paper on Oct. 31, 2008.Read more: Why Are We Still Debating Whether Craig Wright Is Satoshi?Wright said people including Hal Finney, Wei Dai, and Gavin Andresen helped refine his project by giving him fragments of code and helping him de-bug his project.“Did you invite Dave Kleiman prior to 2007 to assist with the coding of bitcoin?” his attorney asked.“No, he couldn’t code,” Wright said.Conflicting datesBy March 2008, Wright testified, he had a handwritten version of what would become the Bitcoin white paper. He reduced that to a 40-page typed version, then a 20-page version, then a 10-page version, which is what he sent Dave Kleiman, he said.On cross-examination, plaintiffs’ counsel showed that Wright’s testimony Monday contradicted what he’d said last week — when he testified he’d sent Dave Kleiman a version of the white paper that was “horrendously long.” They also contended his notes from his meeting from Granger couldn’t be verified with metadata, as they were handwritten.Plaintiffs’ counsel also showed another contradiction: One of Wright’s email addresses was tied to the domain rcjbr.org. On Monday, Wright testified he’d created that domain, which combines the first letters of his wife’s name, his name and his kids’ names – on Oct. 27, 2011. He did not meet his wife until 2010. This detail implied he could not have written an email dated in 2008 from the rcjbr.org address to Dave Kleiman saying, “I need your help editing a paper … bitcash, bitcoin.”In a 2020 video deposition of Wright played for the jury, Wright was asked about the same document: “Is this a real email?” He said he’d sent something similar around that time.“Did you say/send these exact words?” he was asked in the video.“It looks like … yes,” he answered.Another apparent contradiction emerged Monday: Wright testified that he had mined bitcoin with computers in several locations in Australia and had additional servers in Tokyo and Malaysia. The plaintiffs then played a clip from a 2019 video deposition in which he testified he only mined in one Australian location, Bagnoo.Read more: In Craig Wright Trial, Plaintiffs Lay Out Pattern of Fraud, Deceit and HubrisWright’s motion deniedAlso on Monday, federal Judge Beth Bloom issued an order denying a motion by Wright’s legal team to essentially pre-empt the jury on seven counts.On Nov. 16, Wright’s legal team filed a Motion for Judgment of Law, arguing that the plaintiffs had rested their case without providing the jury with enough of an evidentiary basis to find in the plaintiffs’ favor.As the judge’s order explains, if “the court finds that a reasonable jury would not have a legally sufficient evidentiary basis to find for the party on that issue, the court may resolve the issue against the party.”Wright’s team claimed (among other points) that the plaintiffs hadn’t provided enough evidence for the jury to appropriately value the bitcoins and intellectual property that are at issue in the case.Judge Bloom, however, wrote, “The Court is satisfied that the evidence presented at trial affords a sufficient basis for estimating the amount of damages with reasonable certainty. Specifically, the amount of [b]itcoin and its market price provide an adequate basis for the jury to calculate damages.”Similarly, regarding the valuation of intellectual property at issue, the judge’s order pointed out that Wright himself had told the Australian Tax Office that the intellectual property that he acquired after David Kleiman’s death was worth $56 million, and had circulated a report estimating the market price for W&K’s software at $303,895,458. W&K Info Defense Research is one of the business ventures in which the plaintiffs allege Dave Kleiman and Wright were partners.The parties will make closing arguments Tuesday.Catch up on the trial thus far:Kleiman v.

In case Bitcoin manages to settle below this level, it will move towards the next support level at $53,600 which will be bearish for other cryptocurrencies.Crypto markets are under some pressure today, and most leading cryptocurrencies are moving lower. Solana managed to get below the support at $216 and is moving towards the $210 level. XRP is stuck in the tight $1.03 – $1.05 range. Dogecoin is currently trying to settle below $0.22 while Shiba Inu is testing the support at the 50 EMA at $0.00004285.It should be noted that crypto markets have lost positive momentum in recent days, and it looks that their near-term performance will depend on whether Bitcoin manages to stay above the nearest support level at $56,000. If Bitcoin declines below this level, it will gain additional downside momentum which will have a negative impact on crypto markets.Technical AnalysisEthereum is testing the support level at $4,100. If this test is successful, Ethereum will head towards the next support at the 50 EMA at $3,950. RSI is in the moderate territory, and there is plenty of room to gain additional downside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.In case Ethereum gets below the 50 EMA, it will move towards the support at $3,715. A successful test of this level will open the way to the test of the support at $3,580. In case Ethereum manages to settle below this level, it will move towards the support at $3,400.On the upside, Ethereum needs to get above $4,200 to have a chance to test the resistance at the 20 EMA at $4,270. If Ethereum settles above the 20 EMA, it will move towards the next resistance at $4,535. A successful test of this level will open the way to the test of the resistance at $4,650.Story continuesFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Shiba Inu Slips in Coinbase Volume Rankings.

The cryptocurrency fell below the support level of $57,653, the Oct. 23 low, which has opened the doors for a deeper pullback.“There has been an 18% drawdown [from record high], but we have been here several times before, in Sep and Jun this year,” Lennard Neo, head of research at Stack Funds, told CoinDesk in a WhatsApp chat. “Bitcoin is still trading within the upward channel.”Mumbai-based crypto asset management company, MintingM, said that the cryptocurrency is still in a clear uptrend, making higher highs and higher lows on the daily time frame. As seen in the chart below, the upward or bullish channel, representing higher highs and higher lows, can be identified by trendlines connecting the lows of July 20 and Sept. 29, and the highs of June 30 and Sept. 7.Bitcoin was trading near $56,000 at press time, having hit a record high of $68,954 earlier this month.“There hasn’t been any strong catalyst to propel bitcoin’s price forward, and whales [large investors] have not been accumulating like they did in previous bull runs – which paints how global macro uncertainties have kept prices muted,” Stack Funds’ NEO said.Stack Funds’ COO and co-founder Matthew Dibb said the recent decline represents a typical bull market correction and may extended further. “There is mounting concern that inflationary pressures will cause a drop in risk assets, including bitcoin. We believe it will happen at some point, but it is not exactly imminent,” Dibb said.Action in traditional markets indicates potential for a deeper drawdown. The reappointment of Jerome Powell as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, by U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday, reinforced bets that the central bank would hike rates faster to control inflation. U.S. stocks erased early gains, while gold and silver fell after Powell’s reappointment. The dollar index hit a 16-month high of 96.60 early Tuesday and the U.S. two-year yields rose to 0.63%, the highest since March 20.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Bitcoin flipped from support at $57,653 into resistance, with a firm close under the said level on Monday.

Based on technical indicators, Bitcoin’s downside is capped at $53k, which suggests buyers will remain active towards $60K resistance.As part of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, strong dollar amid reports of an Indian Crypto ban trading volumes continue to decline. Although some analysts expect volatility to increase as November draws to a close in the bitcoin and ether options marketsPrices could move sharply over the next few days due to rising volatility, which could discourage buyers from holding onto positions for an extended period of time.Whales deposit Bitcoins at exchanges. Curiously, the exchanges have continued to outflow money, which has resulted in the reserves remaining near their lowest levels since mid-2018.In a report somewhat contradictory, Glassnode said long-term holders may not be spending as much as they were and are therefore more likely to be adding to positions than exiting them.There are two confluences on the chart from a technical perspective: the first is the 38% Fibonacci retracement level, and the second is the trendline that dates back to March 2020 and serves as support.Once the level is successfully backtested as support, it is possible that the uptrend will resume. On the other hand, the 50-day MA (*$60.6K), as well as $60K, seem to be the main immediate resistance levels.Bears might still have some runway left due to the constant trading volume during this correction. This calls for caution.As the RSI is making higher lows on the 4-hour chart, there are signs of bullish divergence, even though the RSI is falling on the daily time frame (but hasn’t reached oversold conditions yet).

Ether, on the other hand, on Wednesday managed to bounce off of its own such trendline.The second-largest token sees good round-number technical support at $4,000, according to Mike McGlone, a commodities analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It seems to be a battle with the leveraged longs from higher levels getting flushed and the longer-term, more institutional bid below the market,” he said. McGlone sees Ether consolidating its bull run within the $4,000 to $5,000 range.Cryptocurrencies have sold off in recent days amid a number of concerns, including greater regulatory risks as well as many tokens having run up very quickly in a short period of time. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which measures the performance of a handful of the largest tokens, has lost 14% so far this month.News that India is preparing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies appears to be behind the latest leg of the selloff in Bitcoin on Wednesday on exchanges popular with Indian investors. Bitcoin was down almost 14% at one point on WazirX while little changed elsewhere.Some analysts are also citing waning risk appetite in the broader equities market, where profitless technology companies have suffered the brunt of the declines.“We see Bitcoin come off in valuation when we see a selloff in the more speculative parts of the equity market,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said by phone.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Bitcoin lost as much as 3.1% to trade at $55,908, while Ether fell 4.2% at one point to $4,168.The important thing is that both Ether and Bitcoin held their lows from last week, according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Those lows -- $55,500 on XBT and $4,000 on XET -- are the more important short-term support levels.”Although Bitcoin has seen a sharp pullback within its intermediate-term uptrend, it is showing signs of short-term downside exhaustion per a number of indicators, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, an independent research firm focused on technical analysis. Plus, its oversold conditions increase the probability that it’s put a low into place.“We expect Bitcoin to resume its intermediate-term uptrend, allowing it to ultimately break out above resistance near $65K for a long-term measured move projection of $90K,” she wrote in a note.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t HelpingWildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the BenefitsHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in AmericaBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","November 24, 2021, 9:10 AM"

91,91.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doomsday-scenarios-defi-revolve-around-090548220.html,Doomsday Scenarios in DeFi Revolve Around Stablecoins USDC and USDT,"If decentralized finance were a character in a fable, we could imagine it as a rebel warrior taking on the world — traditional finance in particular. Then we can think about that rebel’s different body parts as composed of the industry’s best projects so far.So, its two fists might be Uniswap and Curve, the decentralized exchanges that are letting people put their resources behind a lot of ideas and move them around quickly as one fades and another looks promising.Basic financial products that let people do recognizable financial work but in a decentralized way, like Compound, Synthetix, Cover and dYdX, might be the arms that make our warrior strong. Ethereum itself would be — obviously — the heart, while long term plays — like Yearn, Convex and Index Co-op — might be thought of as the left brain and NFTs and crypto hijinks (like Jay Pegs Auto Mart) as the right brain.But what are the legs? What are the projects that, if they were to be cut out from under it, would make our metaphorical warrior fall to earth?Potential Weak PointsBased on crypto leaders The Defiant recently contacted, it seems clear that the legs holding up decentralized finance (DeFi) are two completely centralized products: the fiat-backed tokens, Tether’s stablecoin, USDT, and the stablecoin made by Circle and Coinbase, USDC.Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies built to maintain a price parity (or a “peg”) with something in the analog world, usually the dollar. The two stablecoins in question do this simply by making new tokens from US dollar deposits and promising to redeem their tokens for bank account dollars if any of their clients ask them to do so.Beyond the two stablecoins, there’s a variety of other potential weak points in DeFi right now (oracle manipulation, governance attacks, cross-chain contagion), but anyone looking for potential black swans that could rock the $250 billion locked up in this industry should keep an eye on the top stablecoins.Story continuesFor example, Arjun Bhuptani of the Connext Network sketched out the basic scenario if USDT were to just completely lose its peg due to the longstanding uncertainty about its solvency. Every decentralized exchange pool that held it would fall apart, causing massive losses as folks both rushed to exit their liquidity provider positions and traders attacked them for arbitrage opportunities. Investment protocols, such as Yearn and StakeDAO, that depend on liquidity pools would hemorrhage funds.“I’m pretty worried about the possibility of a major stablecoin de-pegging or being found to be un/undercollateralized. For instance, if there’s a run on USDT, that would likely break most of DeFi”Arjun Bhuptani “I think in general you should consider something like this, a 2008-financial-crisis-like doomsday scenario,” Bhuptani said in an email. “I see no instance where a situation like this doesn’t cause people to panic and try to exit everything they can ASAP, which, in turn, causes a run on most liquidity/debt in the whole DeFi space.”But Bhuptani admits these are just guesses. The truth is no one really knows.“A market crash such as 2017 has no precedent in the DeFi ecosystem yet,” Rafaella Baraldo, co-founder Pods Finance, a hedging platform, wrote in an email. “The closest we have from a crash is March 2020, and by then, the ecosystem was far different from what it is now. On chain usage has increased, and protocols are highly dependent on each other.”Or as Boring Crypto, the pseudonymous coder who designed BentoBox, SushiSwap‘s lending platform, told The Defiant via Twitter DM, “With a few exceptions it’s all a house of cards unfortunately.”Not everyone was quite so nervous. Michael Feng, CEO of CoinAlpha, which made Hummingbot, the market making platform, wrote in an email that USDC and USDT are just not that dangerous. “Those instruments are relatively simple, collateralized by highly liquid instruments like BTC and USD, and under high scrutiny by regulators,” he wrote. “That’s not where the real risks lie.”USDT’s solvency is a worry.Both stablecoins theoretically face the same dangers: regulatory (authorities crack down or demand censorship of certain users), collateral risk (the assets backing the stablecoin lose value or the public loses faith) and security (either collateral gets stolen or unbacked stablecoins get printed and spent before anyone notices).But most people worry more about USDT’s solvency and about USDC’s eagerness to comply with the authorities.If something should go wrong it’s especially scary in crypto because all the technology places extremely high value on finality, that a thing is done once it’s done.“The issue is that DeFi has no form of recourse — there is no undo button,” Hart Lambur, co-founder of the UMA protocol, which makes synthetic assets and other unique financial products, wrote in an email. “It’s pretty hard (maybe impossible?) to build a system that can scale to trillions in value unless there is some way to ‘undo’ bad things when they happen.”Imagine our rebel warrior was suddenly forced to fight with a splint on one leg. That might be a rough metaphor for USDC in a time of regulatory aggression.USDC is the coin of the realm in DeFi. Since around October 2020, it’s been the most popular stablecoin in DeFi by TVL, according to Flipside Crypto.DeFi’s leaders fear regulators will use the two US-based companies behind USDC to put the screws to DeFi, which they could do. USDC is primarily a Circle project and there’s nothing about the company that suggests it would do anything but roll over for the money cops. Its founder, Jeremy Allaire, has been trying to put cryptocurrency into a business suit since before Circle even launched its first products.“I think USDC freezing accounts would cripple DeFi because of how many things ultimately trace back to USDC exposure — DAI, base pairs in many LP pools, etc.” Avichal Garg, managing partner of Electric Capital told The Defiant via email.Freezing funds would not be unprecedented. The question is: will they ever do it at a massive scale?Centre is the organization that Coinbase and Circle set up to run the product. Jessica Gardner from its business operations team sent The Defiant the following statement:“Centre’s Access Denial Policy is … designed to comply with a law, regulation, or legal order from governmental authority with jurisdiction over Centre; or under extreme cases where it’s necessary to prevent a threat to the security, integrity, or reliability of the USDC Network.”Major VulnerabilityWithin DeFi, USDC has enormous scale. Take Uniswap, the crossroads of DeFi. USDC is the second largest token on the application, after ETH, with $581M of the $3.9B locked up in the decentralized exchange, as of Nov. 18, but that’s probably not the most important fact about USDC on Uniswap.USDC is paired with another token in 64 of its pools that have more than $1M in TVL (there are almost 400 pools that have ever had USDC in them and lots more pools with tiny balances).ETH is paired with many more tokens, of course, with 189 pools that have more than $1M, but the next most liquid token on Uniswap, WBTC, is only in 10 pools with over $1M. USDC also makes up $3.5B of the $18.4B supplied value on Compound, the money market. According to The Defiant Terminal’s data, there is 538.5M USDC in Aave (approximately 4% of the total value locked), 1.38B in Curve (~9%), 2.4B in Maker (~13%), 196M in SushiSwap (~5%) and 776M in Uniswap (~9%), as of Nov. 19.For a while there, USDC was a major vulnerability for DAI, the most popular decentralized stablecoin. USDC has made up a dauntingly large portion of collateral for DAI ever since March 2020 when MakerDAO was economically exploited and the system briefly had a few million dollars worth of unbacked DAI.Unforeseen RegulationSince early November, though, USDC is now a reasonable 12% of DAI’s underlying collateral, with ETH itself once again making up the lion’s share, according to DAI stats, and WBTC also a healthy portion.But a failure in confidence in USDC wouldn’t be good for DAI nor any facet of DeFi. and, if USDC ever engenders uncertainty in crypto, it is the most likely to do so by putting law as law before code as law. “Censorship by unforeseen regulation could impact DeFi protocols in a way that we don’t yet understand, ” Baraldo said, echoing a concern brought up by many leaders.Until the authorities act, there’s no way to know how far they will go and what USDC’s stewards will comply with. It might depend on whether or not regulators demand only that certain suspect wallets get frozen or if they go further, ordering that any USDC that has ever touched a suspect wallet gets frozen. Were that to happen, there could be millions of USDC now sitting in smart contracts that would suddenly no longer be liquid.“USDC freeze means big chunks of DeFi have USDC that are frozen but no one knows which addresses actually, so everyone tries to get their USDC out which is basically a run on the bank,” Garg said.Jeremy Allaire is the CEO of Circle.Michael Egorov, Curve’s creator, is less concerned about the censorship scenario. “When USDC or USDT are required to do some things for regulatory compliance which impede their use a lot — but they do not lose backing — that probably would still work,” he told The Defiant via emailThere’s a long term, softer issue as well. USDC is highly associated with Coinbase. Together, they are seen as the legitimate, regulated, “safe” way to be part of the DeFi world. If USDC becomes seen as unreliable, but makes the normies a lot more guarded about this space for a lot longer.“This affects the long-term trust of a portion of the mass market. Which reduces demand of crypto and DeFi in the long run” Lisa Jy Tan of Economics Design told The Defiant via email.Chief FearOf course anyone’s leg can go out at any time, and USDC could certainly give way like anything can — things fall apart, but many people worry more about Tether actually failing than its rival, a scenario in which one of our imagined warrior’s legs loses all its strength.Or even just gets chopped off.There’s a lot of USDT out there too. According to The Defiant Terminal data, there is 183.6M in Aave (approximately 1.4% of TVL), 1.5B in Curve (~9.6%), 413M in Uniswap (~5%) and 97M in SushiSwap (2.6%).The chief fear about USDT is that all the rumors about its solvency have always been true and finally the market becomes convinced. Tether has constantly been hounded by suspicion that it does not hold nearly enough assets to cover all the Tether, all $73 billion worth, in existence.In October, it paid $41M to settle a suit by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its statements that its tokens are fully backed by fiat-currency.“I’m pretty worried about the possibility of a major stablecoin de-pegging or being found to be un/undercollateralized. For instance, if there’s a run on USDT, that would likely break most of DeFi,” Connext’s Bhuptani said.This is not the kind of thing that happens gradually. If it happens, it will happen all at once.“I will describe ‘fail’ as a stablecoin permanently losing its peg. In the most severe case, the stablecoin becomes worthless.”Kenny WhiteIt’s not just DeFi though. USDT’s failure would spread repercussions across every blockchain like fresh cracks in a shattered windshield, because Bitcoin depends on USDT for liquidity. “A big factor in determining whether a failed stablecoin will be an existential crisis or just extremely expensive is how much the price of ETH, BTC and other cryptocurrencies go down,” Kenny White, CEO of Cowri Labs, which makes the Shell Protocol, told The Defiant via email. “My hunch is that a lot of risk modeling underestimates how high this correlation might be.”Tan, however, did not think there was a lot of doubt here about what would happen: “USDT is highly important to BTC trade. USDT fall = BTC ngmi.”And as BTC goes, so does the rest of the market.“First, we should try to define what ‘fail’ means in this context,” White said. “I will describe ‘fail’ as a stablecoin permanently losing its peg. In the most severe case, the stablecoin becomes worthless. There are a variety of ways a stablecoin can fail. If Tether were to fail, at minimum the price of bitcoin, ether and all other crypto currencies would take a huge hit. I also suspect that a few centralized exchanges would be rendered insolvent.”Tether did not reply to multiple requests for comment from The Defiant.Extremely Important ProtocolThe thing about economies is that everything in them is connected, and in DeFi it’s all connected programmatically. Let’s take a particular case in point, that of Curve, the decentralized exchange that specializes in stablecoins of various kinds.As we’ve previously reported, Curve is an extremely important protocol to DeFi’s yield seekers. Stablecoins rely on it to drive liquidity. Yield aggregators rely on it for returns. If a major stablecoin tanked, that would hit Curve extremely hard as well as all projects attached to it.“If USDT were to depeg tomorrow (because, for instance, they found that tether is only 20% collateralized and therefore insolvent), that would cause every USDT-denominated liquidity pool in the space to implode,” Bhuptani said.Curve has been cleverly designed to be flexible. Curve uses metapools in order to improve liquidity. So, while most pools on Uniswap are pools of two tokens that are only dedicated to that pool, Curve uses composability internally. Many pools on Curve are one token paired with another pool (for stablecoins, that’s the 3-Pool, which holds DAI, USDC and USDT).So, anything that goes wrong with 3-Pool spreads immediately to lots of other pools.No Protection“Any other Curve pool holding the 3-Pool LP token will also fail. So basically a majority of Curve would fail (unless there is a back door to freeze the pools and halt trading),” White wrote.Michael Egorov, Curve’s creator, confirmed that an unraveling of any of the big cryptocurrencies would be far reaching. “There is no protection there really. Many pools are dependent on 3-Pool, and if any of the major stables loses the backing forever — this is very bad,” he said via email.From there it spreads, “What happens if a large majority of Curve’s TVL disappears overnight? Protocols such as Yearn would also probably go insolvent. And of course any protocol with exposure to Yearn would be affected,” White said.Beyond that though, it gets a lot harder to predict what will happen, Tan explained. The next question: Do people retreat within crypto or out of crypto entirely? If they retreat within crypto, say to other stablecoins, that could cause their prices to become “messy” she said, as demand pushes up the smaller stablecoins’ prices and then the protocols behind them try to drive the price back down during an erratic time.Central Banks of CryptoWe just don’t know how people and protocols would behave under that kind of stress in this brand new industry.Then there’s another scenario that one of the chief delegates in MakerDAO governance pointed out to The Defiant.Every now and then, a central bank gets caught messing with the rate of interest to borrow their fiat currency, PaperImperium told The Defiant. It doesn’t tend to work out, but it happens.If central banks do it, it’s not impossible to imagine that these central banks of crypto could give in to the same temptation one day.“If Tether or USDC or DAI decided to suppress market interest rates on their coin, they would eventually be in a position where they would run out of reserves to defend their peg on the open market/redemptions,” PaperImperium wrote via Twitter DM.“DeFi composability is awesome, but that means each subsequent building block inherits the risk of underlying blocks…”Arjun BhuptaniHere’s how that could work, in a very simple model: If a stablecoin wanted to see more trading volume, it could supply a lot to lending platforms such as Aave, which would push down the cost to borrow it. If they did it enough, there would end up being more of the coin in the market than the market wanted, so it might start to fall below its peg.Fiat backed stablecoins defend their peg by allowing users to withdraw fiat at the pegged rate. So if, say, USDT did this, and Tether was at $0.97, a big arbitrageur could buy a 10 million USDT and redeem it for USD, clearing an easy $300,000 profit.The danger here is if they keep pushing the borrowing rate down, they lose collateral. Which would maybe matter or maybe it wouldn’t. After all, if they are behaving correctly, tokens get burned as they get redeemed. Under this scenario, though, the financial controls might have come off.“I don’t think anyone would be so economically illiterate as to do that. But as I say, central banks try it (and fail) on a fairly regular basis,” PaperImperium wrote.True DangersIt’s important to keep the really out there threats in mind but the true dangers are probably simpler: a total depegging or regulators making a play to slam on DeFi’s brakes.And it’s also worth remembering that crypto works differently than the traditional economy and might behave differently in a crisis. “Crypto is actually more anti-fragile than traditional finance because holders are a lot more decentralized,” Coin Alpha’s Feng said. “Unlike traditional finance where insolvency of the U.S. government would cause huge problems, there are virtually no ‘too big to fail’ institutions.”Still, one has to keep in mind that DeFi’s applications are hyper-interconnected, and that is why it’s helpful to think of DeFi as one body, as a rebel warrior, albeit with some neat, cutting edge armor and an excellent physique. Nevertheless, it is still all extremely interconnected, like any body, so what hurts one part can create a contagion to the rest.“DeFi composability is awesome, but that means each subsequent building block inherits the risk of underlying blocks,” Bhuptani said.Or maybe it’s not the underlying blocks? Maybe it’s the blocks on top. If the two leading fiat-backed stablecoins really are the legs this industry stands atop? Even the most skilled warrior loses their edge when a leg goes.Read the original post on The Defiant.","November 23, 2021, 1:05 AM"

""Invest here and earn all the money you want,"" he told the euphoric crowd.Supporters have hailed Bukele's plans - including making bitcoin legal tender in September - saying they would bring jobs, financial inclusion and foreign investment to one of the Western Hemisphere's poorest countries.""Feel the Bit"" read the giant screen before Bukele - who brands himself ""CEO of El Salvador"" on Twitter - came on stage.But some in El Salvador and beyond expressed outrage at the glitzy event in a nation beleaguered by inequality, violence and poor public services.""This video makes me sick, angry and sad at the same time,"" said Marce, twitter user @_lamismadeayer.The government says the issuance of $1 billion in ""Volcano bonds"" in partnership with Blockstream - a digital assets infrastructure company - would provide development funds. El Salvador currently faces a $500 million budget gap for next year according to credit rating agency Fitch.But the bitcoin bond is not designed to cover that gap.Half of the bond money would go to infrastructure, including for building Bitcoin City, with the remainder used to purchase bitcoin and locked up for five years. After the lock up, the bitcoin can be sold, generating a capital return that will be split 50-50 between the government and investors, only after the initial $500 million are recouped, according to the plan.Story continuesThe 10-year bitcoin bond offers a 6.5% coupon, payable yearly, but another Salvadoran bond that matures in 2032 is currently yielding close to 13.9%.Financial markets have reacted warily. The spread of Salvadoran yields to safe-haven U.S. Treasuries has widened sharply since late April. This week it added an extra 79 basis points and sits above 1,200 bps, its widest ever.Investors sold off El Salvador's bonds in May after the Bukele-controlled Congress fired the attorney general and five Supreme Court judges, who were replaced with loyalists, critics say.The 2025 bond yields more than 18%, according to Refinitiv data. With such a high cost, the country is effectively excluded from borrowing on the market.Graham Stock, senior sovereign analyst at Blue Bat Asset Management, said government funding through bitcoin could discourage El Salvador from adopting sustainable spending policies, adding the country would likely continue to need International Monetary Fund support.""Building the economy around crypto mining and attracting crypto businesses is an untested strategy to put it mildly,"" he said, adding Bukele did not appear to have plans to increase growth and tax revenues. IMF TALKS STALLEDTalks with the IMF for a $1 billion loan have stalled amid concerns over a lack of transparency and the price volatility of cryptocurrency, as well as fears of democratic backsliding as Bukele consolidates power. But many in the cryptocurrency community are upbeat, saying the bond will harness strong retail demand.""Bitcoin bonds are a game-changer in fixed income markets,” said Moritz Wietersheim, founder of Specter Solutions, a bitcoin security and product company.Although bitcoin has fallen about 16% from its record high of $68,990.90 this month, it remains up over 90% this year.""Bitcoin Week"" marked the first time the digital currency experiment was stress-tested by international crypto evangelists.As vendors hawked ""Jesus Loves Bitcoin"" shirts, panel discussions grouped crypto currency leaders and Salvadoran ministers. Excitement was widespread at having a 'petri dish', as many attendees called El Salvador’s experiment.Several attendees aired worries about the government's Chivo wallet, where Salvadorans can send and receive bitcoin - highlighting tensions over a state tool for a currency created as an alternative to government financial systems.Pre-loaded with $30 for users and backed by a $150 million fund, Chivo allows users to make transactions to other Chivo users fee-free, but registration requires Salvadorans to enter their ID numbers and other personal information while transactions are kept on a ledger.Some attendees described Chivo as a gateway to independent bitcoin wallets, such as Muun or BlueWallet, that offer privacy.""When I make a payment, in the notes section, I write ‘use Muun, don’t use Chivo,’"" said Wietersheim, using the hashtag #FixChivo on Twitter.Since its rollout, Chivo has been criticized for thousands of cases of fraud and money disappearing from wallets.Several programmers said that for the speed of implementation - less than four months after Bukele announced it at a June conference - these technical problems were normal.Bukele has blamed high demand for the issues. A spokesperson for the president's office and Chivo could not be reached for comment.(Additional reporting by Rodrigo Campos in New York; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Aurora Ellis)","November 24, 2021, 11:18 PM"

As a result, we will be limiting the ability for U.S. users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX,” said an eToro spokesperson.Starting December 26, users won’t be able to open new positions in either coin, and their ability to receive a yield for staking those same assets will end on December 31.While eToro assured customers they will not be forced to sell their existing holdings in those cryptocurrencies, both assets came under selling pressure since the announcement. eToro did not specify exactly what concerns prompted the move.   Mati Greenspan, CEO of investment research firm Quantum Economics, told Yahoo Finance that he couldn’t immediately identify which U.S. regulations affect ADA and TRX that don’t also apply to the rest of the crypto market.“As a user and former employee I support their decision but a bit more clarity into their train of thought would be appreciated by the community,” said Greenspan.'Unclear' motivesCardano tumbled after a crypto platform moved to limit trading in the digital coin.The wide reaching effort to rein in what Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has called the ""Wild West"" of digital currencies has stirred uncertainty in the crypto sector. It's led to some market players scrambling to influence the debate over regulation — and others to try and get out ahead of possible enforcement actions, which could be driving eToro's thinking.The SEC classifies Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) - the two largest cryptocurrencies - as commodities instead of securities, but most cryptocurrencies sold on exchanges to U.S. investors aren’t registered as such.Story continuesExpressing his personal views numerous times since taking office as the SEC’s head, Gensler has said that many crypto assets — especially those that fall in the Decentralized Finance or DeFi space — are 'Decentralized In Name Only (DINO)’. That means the SEC could very well begin to take enforcement action on crypto exchanges that offer these assets.In December 2020, the SEC announced that it would sue another top cryptocurrency, Ripple (XRP). While the lawsuit is ongoing, roughly 80 different cryptocurrency exchanges at least briefly de-listed XRP according to Carol Goforth, a Law Professor at the University of Arkansas who specializes in securities and crypto regulation.“That is where I have seen most of the de-listing that has occurred, but it's not clear yet that’s what is going on here,” Goforth told Yahoo Finance.Like stablecoins, crypto lending or offering customers the chance to earn “staking rewards” has drawn scrutiny from regulators. In September, the SEC cut short Coinbase’s efforts to launch their own lending service, with Gensler insisting that the product offering needed to be registered as a security. Meanwhile, crypto lenders BlockFi — reportedly under investigation by the SEC — and Celsius Network have faced numerous cease and desist orders from state securities regulators.There are a number of reasons why an exchange might want to “de-list” a cryptocurrency for U.S. consumers according to Goforth. But she could not determine any unique characteristic of ADA or TRX which would make them a target for regulators. Underscoring the opaqueness of eToro's decision, Bitstamp — a far larger exchange — just recently listed Cardano for trading, which made the move to limit trading ""particularly confusing, unless eToro knows something that we don’t,” said Goforth. Conversely, “Tron has a relatively high trading volume, but again, I don’t see anything that makes it particularly likely to be a target for regulators.”Goforth suggested eToro might have also be using an “internal reviewing” process that points to these assets being riskier, or more likely to be the targets of regulatory attention.David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

Per a press release provided to CoinDesk, Ardana received a grant from NEAR to build a crosschain bridge between Cardano and NEAR.“NEAR’s vision always envisioned a multi-chain world, whereby each blockchain could seamlessly talk and exchange data between one another,” said NEAR foundation CEO Erik Trautman in the release.As multiple Ethereum alternatives gain steam, crosschain bridges are becoming an increasingly important infrastructure tool enabling traders and yield farmers to pursue opportunities across the growing DeFi landscape.Bridges are even emerging as an investable standalone vertical, with a funding round in October for Symbiosis and another in September for LayerZero.The new bridge is also notable for connecting two blockchains poised to make a run at the total value locked (TVL) leaderboard.In October, NEAR announced an $800 million grants program – among the largest of the mammoth incentive programs layer 1s have been offering up in a bid to attract developers. Earlier in the month, Aurora – a platform enabling the Ethereum Virtual Machine smart contract execution environment on the NEAR blockchain – raised $12 million.Likewise, in the latter half of the year Cardano finally released smart contract functionality after years of anticipation, and Three Arrows Capital recently led a raise for Ardana.","November 23, 2021, 6:02 AM"

That said, bitcoin is showing no signs of slowing down with mainstream adoption likely to gain further momentum in the year ahead.”Last month, Ethereum overtook the value of JPMorgan Chase for the first time and is currently the world’s 15th most valuable asset with a market cap of more than half a trillion dollars – $10bn more than JPMorgan’s.Story continuesData from global assets aggregator CompaniesMarketCap shows that Ethereum is also ahead of payments giants Matercard, PayPal and Visa.Read MoreEthereum price smashes record high amid metaverse and NFT buzzWhat’s going on with ethereum?

Based on technical indicators, Bitcoin’s downside is capped at $53k, which suggests buyers will remain active towards $60K resistance.As part of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, strong dollar amid reports of an Indian Crypto ban trading volumes continue to decline. Although some analysts expect volatility to increase as November draws to a close in the bitcoin and ether options marketsPrices could move sharply over the next few days due to rising volatility, which could discourage buyers from holding onto positions for an extended period of time.Whales deposit Bitcoins at exchanges. Curiously, the exchanges have continued to outflow money, which has resulted in the reserves remaining near their lowest levels since mid-2018.In a report somewhat contradictory, Glassnode said long-term holders may not be spending as much as they were and are therefore more likely to be adding to positions than exiting them.There are two confluences on the chart from a technical perspective: the first is the 38% Fibonacci retracement level, and the second is the trendline that dates back to March 2020 and serves as support.Once the level is successfully backtested as support, it is possible that the uptrend will resume. On the other hand, the 50-day MA (*$60.6K), as well as $60K, seem to be the main immediate resistance levels.Bears might still have some runway left due to the constant trading volume during this correction. This calls for caution.As the RSI is making higher lows on the 4-hour chart, there are signs of bullish divergence, even though the RSI is falling on the daily time frame (but hasn’t reached oversold conditions yet).

Ether, on the other hand, on Wednesday managed to bounce off of its own such trendline.The second-largest token sees good round-number technical support at $4,000, according to Mike McGlone, a commodities analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It seems to be a battle with the leveraged longs from higher levels getting flushed and the longer-term, more institutional bid below the market,” he said. McGlone sees Ether consolidating its bull run within the $4,000 to $5,000 range.Cryptocurrencies have sold off in recent days amid a number of concerns, including greater regulatory risks as well as many tokens having run up very quickly in a short period of time. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which measures the performance of a handful of the largest tokens, has lost 14% so far this month.News that India is preparing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies appears to be behind the latest leg of the selloff in Bitcoin on Wednesday on exchanges popular with Indian investors. Bitcoin was down almost 14% at one point on WazirX while little changed elsewhere.Some analysts are also citing waning risk appetite in the broader equities market, where profitless technology companies have suffered the brunt of the declines.“We see Bitcoin come off in valuation when we see a selloff in the more speculative parts of the equity market,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said by phone.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Bitcoin lost as much as 3.1% to trade at $55,908, while Ether fell 4.2% at one point to $4,168.The important thing is that both Ether and Bitcoin held their lows from last week, according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Those lows -- $55,500 on XBT and $4,000 on XET -- are the more important short-term support levels.”Although Bitcoin has seen a sharp pullback within its intermediate-term uptrend, it is showing signs of short-term downside exhaustion per a number of indicators, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, an independent research firm focused on technical analysis. Plus, its oversold conditions increase the probability that it’s put a low into place.“We expect Bitcoin to resume its intermediate-term uptrend, allowing it to ultimately break out above resistance near $65K for a long-term measured move projection of $90K,” she wrote in a note.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t HelpingWildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the BenefitsHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in AmericaBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","November 24, 2021, 9:10 AM"

Howe Institute said.“Canadian-dollar-linked stablecoins could become attractive to Canadians by making them convertible into cash issued by the Bank of Canada, and ensuring that stablecoins are well designed and regulated from business conduct, competitive, operational, privacy and prudential perspectives,” wrote Mark Zelmer and Jeremy Kronick, the authors of the report.A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price. Recently nominated vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Lael Brainard, has voiced her support for the potential advantages of a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC).Indirect CBDCSuch a feat by the Bank of Canada will require any potential stablecoins to be well designed and regulated to make them attractive to Canadians, Zelmer and Kronick wrote. The digital currency should also be issued in token form, with decentralized technology for settling transactions, allowing Canadians to retain most of the benefits of a paper currency, the authors added.“Our preference is for an ‘indirect CBDC,’ one that is allowed to pass over the balance sheet of payment providers, mimicking cash/banknotes on the Bank of Canada’s balance sheet today,” the duo said.The authors also highlighted that such adoption may incentivize private sectors to introduce Canadian-dollar linked stablecoins by enabling convertibility to cash to take place digitally, without relying on physical bank notes.On Feb. 25, Canadian bank VersaBank said it plans to launch a stablecoin “VCAD” which will be pegged to the Canadian dollar on a 1:1 ratio basis.A new chapterThe Bank of Canada adopting a digital currency that is convertible into Canadian dollars could usher in a new chapter in how Canadians pay for their goods and services. According to the report, however, this move can only be successful if there is a mass adoption by the consumers and there are infrastructures to support such use of digital currencies.“Canadians are more likely to favor those stablecoins if governments facilitate innovation in the payments world so that Canadians can benefit from ongoing advances in payments systems and crypto-technology, and the purchasing power of the Canadian dollar is maintained by keeping inflation low,” the authors concluded.","November 25, 2021, 10:21 AM"

To sign up click here and scroll down to the tech icon.NewslettersHere’s a teaser from this week’s edition:Amid a flurry of fireworks, blaring rock music and cheering crowds, the president of El Salvador took to the stage at LaBitConf 2021 conference over the weekend to unveil his vision for a volcano-powered ‘Bitcoin City’.As arguably the world’s least conventional world leader, Nayib Bukele is as disruptive and divisive as bitcoin itself. The self-proclaimed “coolest dictator in the world” and “CEO of El Salvador” oversaw the country becoming the first in the world to adopt the cryptocurrency as a legal form of tender earlier this year, and has plans to begin a revolution not just in his country, but the entire world.Decked in all white and wearing his trademark backwards baseball cap, Bukele used Alexander the Great as an analogy for what he was hoping to achieve with Bitcoin City. “When Alexander the Great was conquering the world, he established these Alexandria cities all over the empire,” he told the crowd. “The whole point of these Alexandrias was to be the beacons of hope for the rest of the world. I thought, if you want bitcoin to spread all over the world, we should build some Alexandrias. We should build the first Alexandria here in El Salvador.”Built in the shadow of the Conchagua volcano on the country’s southern tip, Bitcoin City is envisioned as a kind of libertarian utopia crossed with an environmentalist’s fantasyland, combining zero income and property tax with zero CO2 emissions.It will be a proper legal municipality, complete with an elected mayor, residential and commercial areas, museums, airports – “everything devoted to bitcoin” – even a plaza designed in the shape of the cryptocurrency’s logo.To finance the city, El Salvador partnered with digital assets firm Blockstream to launch a $1 billion bitcoin bond, with the company saying the city will bring about the acceleration of “hyperbitcoinisation” – a bold new era where the cryptocurrency usurps the US dollar to become the default value system of the world.Bitcoin evangelicals like Bukele cite the digital currency’s borderless, censorship-resistant technology for its potential to displace the dollar and transform the current financial system into one that favours the masses, not just the massively wealthy...Bitcoin price collapse explainedTuesday 23 November 2021 16:12 , Anthony CuthbertsonBitcoin is now down more than $10,000 from the peak it reached on 10 November, with still no solid signs of the price slide stopping.Speaking to various analysts and experts, we heard their thoughts on what caused this latest price correction – and where the cryptocurrency might go from here. Reasons range from the US infrastructure bill, to the liquidation of MtGox assets that account for more than 3 per cent of the entire circulating supply of BTC.You can read the full story here:Bitcoin’s price collapse explainedElon Musk questions ‘shady’ BinanceTuesday 23 November 2021 10:27 , Anthony CuthbertsonElon Musk has questioned the CEO of Binance about the crypto exchange’s treatment of dogecoin users.Binance boss Changpeng Zhao, known as CZ, has previously said he “doesn’t get” dogecoin and caused outrage among fans of the meme-inspired token after temporarily suspending doge withdrawals last week after a “minor issue”.Musk, who is one of the most high-profile fans of dogecoin, asked CZ on Twitter this morning: “What’s going on with your Doge customers?

Some analysts are saying there is resistance at this level, though during periods of price discovery the market can be particularly volatile.Other leading cryptocurrencies are also seeing heavy losses, with Ethereum (ether), Binance Coin, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ada) all falling in price by between 5- 8 per cent on Monday.Here’s what Simon Peters, an analyst at the online trading platform eToro, has to say about the latest market correction: “With bitcoin and other cryptoassets having reached fresh all-time highs, there was always likely to be a measure of profit-taking from investors which then translates into price weakness. Both BTC and ETH go from strength to strength, and the ups and downs of the market are a part of this story.”President Bukele to keynote major bitcoin conferenceMonday 22 November 2021 17:16 , Anthony CuthbertsonAfter barely catching his breath from belting out his ambition to build Bitcoin City, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has said he will appear at one of the biggest cryptocurrency conferences on the calendar.Bitcoin 2022 will take place in Miami next April, providing a platform for many of the leading figures within the crypto industry. Up to 35,00 people are expected to attend the four-day event, one year after President Bukele first announced that his country would be the first in the world to introduce bitcoin as a legal form of tender.After virtually announcing my intention to make Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador at Bitcoin 2021, I am pleased to be speaking at Bitcoin 2022 in person to deliver an update on the progress we have made as the world’s first Bitcoin-native country.El Salvador President Nayib Bukele‘PayPal for crypto' startup MoonPay raises $555 millionMonday 22 November 2021 16:38 , Anthony CuthbertsonCryptocurrency firm MoonPay is now valued at a staggering $3.4 billion after just announcing a $555 million funding round.The Miami-based fintech firm has described itself as “similar to PayPal, but for crypto”, as its software allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency using traditional payment methods like bank transfer, credit and debit cards, and mobile apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay.At just three years old, it is the latest company to benefit from a record-breaking year for cryptocurrency.

At the time it was considered to be the largest city in the ancient world before being overtaken by Rome.The idea of Bitcoin City in El Salvador would include a quadruple-threat approach to an urban location, plus renewed ideas regarding energy, physical space, and taxation.That also means the city would not suffer from CO2 emissions since everything would be powered by the volcano adjacent to the planned site.The only taxation of a citizen in Bitcoin City would be a 10% sales tax.Bitcoin-backed bonds as a guaranteeBitcoin City would also be partially be funded by Bitcoin-backed bonds – a local government issue of a $1bn tokenized bond that will carry a 6.5% yield for investors.Samson Mow, chief strategy officer of Blockstream, said the plans include making El Salvador “the financial centre of the world” and “the Singapore of Latin America”.Mow also added he expects other countries to follow suit.“The first countries that do this will have a massive advantage. This is the beginning of nation-state Bitcoin FOMO,” Mow said, referring to the term ‘fear of missing out’.According to Blockstream’s blog post “the $1bn raised will be split between a $500m allocation of Bitcoin (BTC) and a $500m infrastructure spend for building out energy and Bitcoin mining infrastructure in the region”.El Salvador also aims to create a government securities law and grant a license to Bitfinex Securities to process the bond issuance.Also, the Bitcoin Bond would have special dividends dispersed on an annual basis generated by the staggered liquidation of Bitcoin.Using Blockstream’s Asset Management Platform (AMP), dividends are easily paid out to bondholders.","November 23, 2021, 7:15 AM"

The digital currency was valued at around $300,000 at the time, the report said.De Rose's lawyers said no harm came to the alleged victim because the man was found to have illegally sold it into the market. The American was ""found to be so crooked"" that the cryptocurrency has no value, Edward Fitzgerald, De Rose's lawyer, said in court, according to the report.But just because the victim fell afoul of the US Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't ""allow Mr. Rose and his friends to act as Robin Hood"" and take the man's assets for their gain, said Peter Caldwell, a lawyer for the UK's Crown Prosecution Service. ""This is a very serious fraud,"" he said.De Rose's lawyers said he should stand trial in the UK rather than being extradited because a substantial portion of his alleged crimes took place in the UK.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 23, 2021, 7:20 AM"
129,129.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cardano-tron-sink-as-etoro-slaps-limits-on-both-citing-evolving-cryptocurrency-debate-172946749.html,"Cardano, Tron sink as Etoro slaps limits on both, citing 'evolving' cryptocurrency debate","Cryptocurrencies Cardano (ADA) and TRON (TRX) sank on Wednesday, following a decision by online trading platform eToro to delist the digital coins on its platform — a move that left crypto market watchers flummoxed.TRON tumbled by over 5% on the day, while Cardano has sold off by over 8%, according to market data.In a terse statement, the exchange based its decision on unspecified regulatory reasons, but it comes at a time when authorities are moving to exert more control over the crypto sector, in a bid to protect investors. “The regulatory landscape for crypto is evolving rapidly. As a result, we will be limiting the ability for U.S. users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX,” said an eToro spokesperson.Starting December 26, users won’t be able to open new positions in either coin, and their ability to receive a yield for staking those same assets will end on December 31.While eToro assured customers they will not be forced to sell their existing holdings in those cryptocurrencies, both assets came under selling pressure since the announcement. eToro did not specify exactly what concerns prompted the move.   Mati Greenspan, CEO of investment research firm Quantum Economics, told Yahoo Finance that he couldn’t immediately identify which U.S. regulations affect ADA and TRX that don’t also apply to the rest of the crypto market.“As a user and former employee I support their decision but a bit more clarity into their train of thought would be appreciated by the community,” said Greenspan.'Unclear' motivesCardano tumbled after a crypto platform moved to limit trading in the digital coin.The wide reaching effort to rein in what Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has called the ""Wild West"" of digital currencies has stirred uncertainty in the crypto sector. It's led to some market players scrambling to influence the debate over regulation — and others to try and get out ahead of possible enforcement actions, which could be driving eToro's thinking.The SEC classifies Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) - the two largest cryptocurrencies - as commodities instead of securities, but most cryptocurrencies sold on exchanges to U.S. investors aren’t registered as such.Story continuesExpressing his personal views numerous times since taking office as the SEC’s head, Gensler has said that many crypto assets — especially those that fall in the Decentralized Finance or DeFi space — are 'Decentralized In Name Only (DINO)’. That means the SEC could very well begin to take enforcement action on crypto exchanges that offer these assets.In December 2020, the SEC announced that it would sue another top cryptocurrency, Ripple (XRP). While the lawsuit is ongoing, roughly 80 different cryptocurrency exchanges at least briefly de-listed XRP according to Carol Goforth, a Law Professor at the University of Arkansas who specializes in securities and crypto regulation.“That is where I have seen most of the de-listing that has occurred, but it's not clear yet that’s what is going on here,” Goforth told Yahoo Finance.Like stablecoins, crypto lending or offering customers the chance to earn “staking rewards” has drawn scrutiny from regulators. In September, the SEC cut short Coinbase’s efforts to launch their own lending service, with Gensler insisting that the product offering needed to be registered as a security. Meanwhile, crypto lenders BlockFi — reportedly under investigation by the SEC — and Celsius Network have faced numerous cease and desist orders from state securities regulators.There are a number of reasons why an exchange might want to “de-list” a cryptocurrency for U.S. consumers according to Goforth. But she could not determine any unique characteristic of ADA or TRX which would make them a target for regulators. Underscoring the opaqueness of eToro's decision, Bitstamp — a far larger exchange — just recently listed Cardano for trading, which made the move to limit trading ""particularly confusing, unless eToro knows something that we don’t,” said Goforth. Conversely, “Tron has a relatively high trading volume, but again, I don’t see anything that makes it particularly likely to be a target for regulators.”Goforth suggested eToro might have also be using an “internal reviewing” process that points to these assets being riskier, or more likely to be the targets of regulatory attention.David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

Lord of the Rings-themed crypto token has been blocked by JRR Tolkien's estate,"A gold ringPBO PhotographyThe family of Lord of the Rings author JRR Tolkien have won a court ruling to shut down a ""ring trilogy-themed"" crypto token.The creator of the ""JRR token"" must cease trading and remove all infringing content, according to media reports.A number of cryptocurrencies have arisen from pop culture such as dogecoin, the Squid Game token and even Elon Musk's dog.Sign up here for our daily newsletter, 10 Things Before the Opening Bell.A cryptocurrency inspired by the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy was barred from operating on Tuesday after the family and estate of author JRR Tolkien brought legal action against the digital token's creator.The ""JRR token"", created by Florida-based developer Matthew Jensen, launched in August this year. Tolkien's estate brought a copyright infringement complaint to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) within weeks, stating the token's website included references to the writer's famous fantasy fiction series, including its characters and other images.At the center of the complaint was the use of the domain name ""www.jrrtoken.com"". The WIPO arbitration process found in favor of Tolkien's estate. According to a press release emailed on Tuesday by the Tolkein family's lawyers - Maier Blackburn Solicitors - Jensen must immediately cease trading and remove all content referring to the token across its website and social media accounts.The token which had launched in August had managed to accumulate 512 wallet addresses according to BSC scan. It also listed nine non-fungible tokens for sale on the OpenSea marketplace.""This was a particularly flagrant case of infringement, and the estate is pleased that it has been concluded on satisfactory terms,"" Steve Maier, of Maier Blackburn Solicitors, said in the statement.Jensen was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Insider.As part of the WIPO arbitration, Jensen had said the domain name was not identical to the Lord of the Rings creator's name. ""Specifically, the Complainant's J R R TOLKIEN trademark contains the additional letters ""L"" and ""I"" which are conspicuously absent from the disputed domain name. The pronunciation is also different,"" he said.Story continuesThe JRR Token's website, Twitter account and YouTube channel have now been deleted.With hundreds of new cryptocurrencies created daily, it's unlikely that the demise of the Lord of the Rings-inspired token will mark the end of digital tokens inspired by mainstream culture. Dogecoin, one of the world's most widely traded cryptos, was based on a popular internet meme, giving rise to spinoffs that include the floki inu token, named after Elon Musk's dog. They're not all harmless though. Earlier this month saw the sudden rise of the Squid Game token, which took its name from the record-breaking Korean Netflix show, that later turned out to be fraudulent.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 23, 2021, 7:23 AM"

To sign up click here and scroll down to the tech icon.NewslettersHere’s a teaser from this week’s edition:Amid a flurry of fireworks, blaring rock music and cheering crowds, the president of El Salvador took to the stage at LaBitConf 2021 conference over the weekend to unveil his vision for a volcano-powered ‘Bitcoin City’.As arguably the world’s least conventional world leader, Nayib Bukele is as disruptive and divisive as bitcoin itself. The self-proclaimed “coolest dictator in the world” and “CEO of El Salvador” oversaw the country becoming the first in the world to adopt the cryptocurrency as a legal form of tender earlier this year, and has plans to begin a revolution not just in his country, but the entire world.Decked in all white and wearing his trademark backwards baseball cap, Bukele used Alexander the Great as an analogy for what he was hoping to achieve with Bitcoin City. “When Alexander the Great was conquering the world, he established these Alexandria cities all over the empire,” he told the crowd. “The whole point of these Alexandrias was to be the beacons of hope for the rest of the world. I thought, if you want bitcoin to spread all over the world, we should build some Alexandrias. We should build the first Alexandria here in El Salvador.”Built in the shadow of the Conchagua volcano on the country’s southern tip, Bitcoin City is envisioned as a kind of libertarian utopia crossed with an environmentalist’s fantasyland, combining zero income and property tax with zero CO2 emissions.It will be a proper legal municipality, complete with an elected mayor, residential and commercial areas, museums, airports – “everything devoted to bitcoin” – even a plaza designed in the shape of the cryptocurrency’s logo.To finance the city, El Salvador partnered with digital assets firm Blockstream to launch a $1 billion bitcoin bond, with the company saying the city will bring about the acceleration of “hyperbitcoinisation” – a bold new era where the cryptocurrency usurps the US dollar to become the default value system of the world.Bitcoin evangelicals like Bukele cite the digital currency’s borderless, censorship-resistant technology for its potential to displace the dollar and transform the current financial system into one that favours the masses, not just the massively wealthy...Bitcoin price collapse explainedTuesday 23 November 2021 16:12 , Anthony CuthbertsonBitcoin is now down more than $10,000 from the peak it reached on 10 November, with still no solid signs of the price slide stopping.Speaking to various analysts and experts, we heard their thoughts on what caused this latest price correction – and where the cryptocurrency might go from here.

Some analysts are saying there is resistance at this level, though during periods of price discovery the market can be particularly volatile.Other leading cryptocurrencies are also seeing heavy losses, with Ethereum (ether), Binance Coin, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ada) all falling in price by between 5- 8 per cent on Monday.Here’s what Simon Peters, an analyst at the online trading platform eToro, has to say about the latest market correction: “With bitcoin and other cryptoassets having reached fresh all-time highs, there was always likely to be a measure of profit-taking from investors which then translates into price weakness. Both BTC and ETH go from strength to strength, and the ups and downs of the market are a part of this story.”President Bukele to keynote major bitcoin conferenceMonday 22 November 2021 17:16 , Anthony CuthbertsonAfter barely catching his breath from belting out his ambition to build Bitcoin City, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has said he will appear at one of the biggest cryptocurrency conferences on the calendar.Bitcoin 2022 will take place in Miami next April, providing a platform for many of the leading figures within the crypto industry. Up to 35,00 people are expected to attend the four-day event, one year after President Bukele first announced that his country would be the first in the world to introduce bitcoin as a legal form of tender.After virtually announcing my intention to make Bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador at Bitcoin 2021, I am pleased to be speaking at Bitcoin 2022 in person to deliver an update on the progress we have made as the world’s first Bitcoin-native country.El Salvador President Nayib Bukele‘PayPal for crypto' startup MoonPay raises $555 millionMonday 22 November 2021 16:38 , Anthony CuthbertsonCryptocurrency firm MoonPay is now valued at a staggering $3.4 billion after just announcing a $555 million funding round.The Miami-based fintech firm has described itself as “similar to PayPal, but for crypto”, as its software allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency using traditional payment methods like bank transfer, credit and debit cards, and mobile apps like Apple Pay and Google Pay.At just three years old, it is the latest company to benefit from a record-breaking year for cryptocurrency.

Howe Institute said.“Canadian-dollar-linked stablecoins could become attractive to Canadians by making them convertible into cash issued by the Bank of Canada, and ensuring that stablecoins are well designed and regulated from business conduct, competitive, operational, privacy and prudential perspectives,” wrote Mark Zelmer and Jeremy Kronick, the authors of the report.A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price. Recently nominated vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Lael Brainard, has voiced her support for the potential advantages of a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC).Indirect CBDCSuch a feat by the Bank of Canada will require any potential stablecoins to be well designed and regulated to make them attractive to Canadians, Zelmer and Kronick wrote. The digital currency should also be issued in token form, with decentralized technology for settling transactions, allowing Canadians to retain most of the benefits of a paper currency, the authors added.“Our preference is for an ‘indirect CBDC,’ one that is allowed to pass over the balance sheet of payment providers, mimicking cash/banknotes on the Bank of Canada’s balance sheet today,” the duo said.The authors also highlighted that such adoption may incentivize private sectors to introduce Canadian-dollar linked stablecoins by enabling convertibility to cash to take place digitally, without relying on physical bank notes.On Feb. 25, Canadian bank VersaBank said it plans to launch a stablecoin “VCAD” which will be pegged to the Canadian dollar on a 1:1 ratio basis.A new chapterThe Bank of Canada adopting a digital currency that is convertible into Canadian dollars could usher in a new chapter in how Canadians pay for their goods and services. According to the report, however, this move can only be successful if there is a mass adoption by the consumers and there are infrastructures to support such use of digital currencies.“Canadians are more likely to favor those stablecoins if governments facilitate innovation in the payments world so that Canadians can benefit from ongoing advances in payments systems and crypto-technology, and the purchasing power of the Canadian dollar is maintained by keeping inflation low,” the authors concluded.","November 25, 2021, 10:21 AM"

Photo: Screen grab from Parliament LiveBank of England (BoE) officials have said that if a central bank digital currency (CBDC) was introduced, 20% of deposits could move out of the commercial banking system as a result.Speaking at the Economic Affairs Committee in the Lords on Tuesday, Sir Jon Cunliffe, the bank's deputy governor for financial stability, said it had made a ""prudent assessment"" of the 20% move. He also said banks could potentially lose a revenue stream from payments as a result of its implementation. Cunliffe added that if banks are healthy and competitive they will adjust to this change, just as they had been nimble in the face of change in the past. He also said that there is a future in cash too, which would have an anchoring role in financial stability of systems. A potential digital pound, dubbed 'Britcoin' by the press, has been in the offing since April this year. In September, the bank brought in representatives from ASOS (ASC.L), Spotify (SPOT) and PayPal (PYPL), among other companies, to consult on its CBDC Engagement and Technology forums.BoE governor Andrew Bailey also told the committee that despite the ""large and rapid growth"" of stable coins and digital assets around the world, it is ""not regarded as a direct financial stability issue"". The question becomes, 'how do we tackle that world?', he said, offering two options. One would be to regulate so-called stable coins and the other would be to bring in a CBDC. Read more: Lord of the Rings cryptocurrency taken to task by JRR Tolkien's estateCunliffe went on to say that there are a number of issues that need to be addressed and tested before any CBDC is brought in in the UK, as well as time given for the banking system to adjust while it changes. He also said the bank didn't yet have visibility on predicted uptake by consumers as it did not yet know the full scope of what a CBDC would mean for the UK. Story continuesThe bank recently laid out its plans for the next stage of development in digital currency in the UK. If the results of this ""development"" phase conclude that the case for CBDC is made, and that it is operationally and technologically robust, then the earliest date for launch of a UK CBDC would be in the second half of the decade, it said at the time.In a statement earlier in November, the Bank said that in 2022, the Treasury and the Bank will launch a consultation which will set out their assessment of the case for a UK CBDC, including the merits of further work to develop an operational and technology model.Watch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?","November 23, 2021, 8:09 AM"

It seems society has suddenly propelled back to the future as we have seen nations start to adopt a phenomenon known to many as crypto — the world’s newest medium of exchange.The best way to describe crypto is as the digital currency it is, thinking of the many different types of cryptocurrency as currencies with different utilities. The one quality that they all share is that they contribute to the creation of a richer digital experience.The Bitcoin logo appears on the display screen of a cryptocurrency ATM at the Smoker’s Choice store in Salem, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)The challenging part is understanding that cryptocurrency fluctuates rapidly and can be volatile — sparking the interest of investors and micro-investors throughout the world who are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. Some experts believe cryptocurrency is all about timing and crypto-believers argue that cash and the USD is archaic and truly the inferior form of currency … but are these investors right?It is impossible to demystify the secret of cryptocurrency without answering the infamous question — what is blockchain? Often discussed in tandem, many mix up the idea of cryptocurrency with blockchain, and others simply don’t know the difference.Blockchain is a decentralized technology that is incredibly secure (think of the root of the word crypto — as in encryption). The benefit of blockchains is that its technology is spread across many different computer operating systems, thus arguably making them more secure than existing payment systems.Easily accessible crypto-wallets like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Gemini, have made it easy to buy and sell over 50 different cryptocurrencies. Gemini is particularly interesting because of its founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who started the company in 2014.If you ever watched The Social Network, you will remember the Winklevoss Twins — the two brothers that infamously founded HarvardConnection, a social media network on Harvard’s campus that predated Facebook. Although the Winklevoss brothers seemed to have lost the Facebook war, they continue to prove themselves as formidable opponents to Mark Zuckerberg in the “Metaverse”— going on to found one of cryptocurrency’s leading exchanges.Story continuesHowever, while the Winklevoss brothers have used this and their other investments to propel them into the billionaire stratosphere along with their rival Zuckerberg — cryptocurrency has always had a different meaning for Black and Brown people.For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberation. In this case, it comes as no surprise that Black people have been, by and large, leading the cryptocurrency boom. The University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center reports that 46% of cryptocurrency holders are people of color — with 18% of those holders being Black. These numbers make sense considering the deep seated distrust in the Black community surrounding government regulation and the wealth gap.The Bitcoin logo is displayed on the side of a Bitcoin ATM on November 10, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)To many, cryptocurrency will serve as the great equalizer that education was once viewed as in this country. Accessibility is another reason for cryptocurrency’s success within the Black community. Investors can purchase cryptocurrency at a painfully low entry point — you only need a dollar to buy crypto as you can fractionally invest in currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum buying a minute fraction of the coin.This enables folks with less disposable income to get in on the fun whereas the stock market has traditionally excluded these population groups. But cryptocurrency has implications that span far larger than just Black America. Cryptocurrency has also become a force to be reckoned with on the forefront of the global community. This has left many economists asking the question of what crypto means for the global economy?Akon was perhaps one of the first celebrities to openly discuss cryptocurrency and its ramifications, as early as 2018, when he declared his own cryptocurrency, Akoin. Akon noted that this cryptocurrency would guide Africa into financial freedom and be the basis upon which his futuristic city would be built.If Akon’s plan does succeed, it would liberate the Senegalese people from the French-backed CFA (the national currency of Senegal and many Francophone countries in West Africa). But Senegal isn’t the only African country interested in cryptocurrency. Nigeria has quickly grown to be the second largest market for crypto trading, following the United States.Akon attends the Jingle Bell Ball at the O2 Arena on December 5, 2010 in London, England. (Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)Many Nigerians have found the use of cryptocurrency as a solvent way to protect their money against the depreciation of the Naira (which is linked to the USD.) Moreover, cryptocurrency simplifies the transference of remittances (money sent back home by nationals or family members who live internationally) and minimizes costs and fees. The issue of remittances is a phenomenon that can be seen throughout the African continent and across the pond in the Caribbean and Latin America as well.El Salvador has led the Latin American community in cryptocurrency, becoming the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. Both President Nayib Bukele and Maria Luisa Hayem, El Salvador’s Minister of Economy, are proud to have led Latin America into this innovative economic revolution. Despite their efforts, adoption has been slow, with only 12% of consumers using cryptocurrency since the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in September.Yet not all countries have bought into the hype, with China banning all crypto-related transactions and deeming them illegal. Crypto economist and attorney Jamar Montgomery thinks it’s because “open source cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are a threat to a government’s control over a monetary and financial system.”While these governments desperately cling to the little financial control they have left — the rest of the world seems to be moving toward a new age. With even the infamous Los Angeles Staples Arena being renamed and rebranded to reflect a new moniker, “crypto.com,” it is certainly reflective of the new age of cryptocurrency.Wen-Kuni Ceant, theGrio.comWen-kuni Ceant is the CEO and Co-Founder of Politicking.

As a result, we will be limiting the ability for U.S. users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX,” said an eToro spokesperson.Starting December 26, users won’t be able to open new positions in either coin, and their ability to receive a yield for staking those same assets will end on December 31.While eToro assured customers they will not be forced to sell their existing holdings in those cryptocurrencies, both assets came under selling pressure since the announcement. eToro did not specify exactly what concerns prompted the move.   Mati Greenspan, CEO of investment research firm Quantum Economics, told Yahoo Finance that he couldn’t immediately identify which U.S. regulations affect ADA and TRX that don’t also apply to the rest of the crypto market.“As a user and former employee I support their decision but a bit more clarity into their train of thought would be appreciated by the community,” said Greenspan.'Unclear' motivesCardano tumbled after a crypto platform moved to limit trading in the digital coin.The wide reaching effort to rein in what Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has called the ""Wild West"" of digital currencies has stirred uncertainty in the crypto sector. It's led to some market players scrambling to influence the debate over regulation — and others to try and get out ahead of possible enforcement actions, which could be driving eToro's thinking.The SEC classifies Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) - the two largest cryptocurrencies - as commodities instead of securities, but most cryptocurrencies sold on exchanges to U.S. investors aren’t registered as such.Story continuesExpressing his personal views numerous times since taking office as the SEC’s head, Gensler has said that many crypto assets — especially those that fall in the Decentralized Finance or DeFi space — are 'Decentralized In Name Only (DINO)’. That means the SEC could very well begin to take enforcement action on crypto exchanges that offer these assets.In December 2020, the SEC announced that it would sue another top cryptocurrency, Ripple (XRP). While the lawsuit is ongoing, roughly 80 different cryptocurrency exchanges at least briefly de-listed XRP according to Carol Goforth, a Law Professor at the University of Arkansas who specializes in securities and crypto regulation.“That is where I have seen most of the de-listing that has occurred, but it's not clear yet that’s what is going on here,” Goforth told Yahoo Finance.Like stablecoins, crypto lending or offering customers the chance to earn “staking rewards” has drawn scrutiny from regulators. In September, the SEC cut short Coinbase’s efforts to launch their own lending service, with Gensler insisting that the product offering needed to be registered as a security. Meanwhile, crypto lenders BlockFi — reportedly under investigation by the SEC — and Celsius Network have faced numerous cease and desist orders from state securities regulators.There are a number of reasons why an exchange might want to “de-list” a cryptocurrency for U.S. consumers according to Goforth. But she could not determine any unique characteristic of ADA or TRX which would make them a target for regulators. Underscoring the opaqueness of eToro's decision, Bitstamp — a far larger exchange — just recently listed Cardano for trading, which made the move to limit trading ""particularly confusing, unless eToro knows something that we don’t,” said Goforth. Conversely, “Tron has a relatively high trading volume, but again, I don’t see anything that makes it particularly likely to be a target for regulators.”Goforth suggested eToro might have also be using an “internal reviewing” process that points to these assets being riskier, or more likely to be the targets of regulatory attention.David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

Bitcoin is being heralded as an inflation hedge on a par with gold and ether is rapidly becoming the cryptocurrency of choice for decentralized finance, play-to-earn games, digital collectors' items, known as non-fungible tokens, and likely soon, the metaverse.But it's not either of these two cryptocurrencies that have captured the public's imagination.Dogecoin, which was founded by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmers in 2013 as a joke, has been the most searched-for cryptocurrency in the largest number of states so far this year, according to research by The Advisor Coach, a financial advisor. The coin, which is based on an internet meme of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog, was the most-googled in 23 states, including Florida, Illinois and Michigan.This year, it shot to prominence, thanks in large part to the Twitter-based cheerleading of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who is a known crypto enthusiast that holds dogecoin, bitcoin and ether. Musk even went so far as saying in May this year that he might accept dogecoin as payment for his company's electric vehicles.By that point, dogecoin was already beloved among the army of Reddit retail traders, who had pushed the coin up to around $0.07, from closer to $0.007 at the start of the year and Musk's payment remark sent the price to a record $0.70. It's since eased to around $0.24, but it's still one of the crypto stars of 2021, with a gain of nearly 5,000% so far.Story continues""The rise in interest can be partially attributed to the endorsement of Elon Musk who stated earlier in the year that Tesla would accept dogecoin as a form of payment,"" The Advisor Coach note said.Crypto traders' adoration of Musk extends well beyond what coins he holds and has given rise to dogecoin spinoffs. The Tesla boss even owns a Shiba Inu. There's now a shiba inu coin, and even a floki inu, named after Musk's real-life pup, Floki.By contrast, bitcoin, the biggest and original cryptocurrency, was the most-searched for in just 10 states, including Connecticut, Alaska and Mississippi, ranking it second in the list. Bitcoin has led the surge in appetite for and adoption of cryptocurrencies. The total market value of crypto assets is hovering at close to $3 trillion, having risen from around $500 billion a year earlier, according to CoinGecko.Ether came in third place, being the most searched in eight states, while shiba inu landed in fourth place. Interestingly, shiba inu was the most-searched for cryptocurrency in New York, home to Wall Street and the country's most powerful financial institutions.Map of crypto google searchesThe Advisor CoachRead the original article on Business Insider","November 24, 2021, 6:30 AM"

Here's a refresher on the craziest stories this year, from meme stocks to NFTs.","The Thanksgiving turkey.Hiroko Masuike/Getty ImagesMarkets have been on a wild ride in 2021 amid new phenomena like meme stocks, NFTs, and DAOs.The year began with shares of GameStop soaring and is ending with a DAO trying to buy the US Constitution.Here are 10 conversation starters about markets to avoid politics at Thanksgiving this year.Forget politics at your Thanksgiving dinner this year. Talk markets.Think about everything that happened this year, starting with an army of retail traders causing GameStop shares to spike, to cute Japanese puppies becoming the mascots for a crypto revolution, and ending in a bunch of internet friends trying to buy the US Constitution.So here's a refresher of what happened with 10 possible ideas to get the conversation going on Thanksgiving.1) What's your favorite meme stock?Meme stocks became the first big market event this year when an army of retail traders mobilized on Reddit to drive up the prices of cheap stocks like GameStop, AMC, and BlackBerry. Then well-known trading app Robinhood halted the buying of meme stocks, initiating an uproar from traders, a Congressional hearing and a regulatory report. The meme-stock phenomenon has continued throughout the year, with new companies constantly added to the basket. For some, AMC is still their favorite. It's now accepting cryptocurrency as payment, and its CEO is a hit among retail traders.2) Want to see my NFT?Non-fungible tokens surged in popularity this year, and now the market as a whole is worth billions of dollars. The tokens are generally digital pieces of art tied to the blockchain. They're worth anywhere from a handful of dollars to millions of dollars. If you're really a crypto enthusiast, you might even bring your tungsten cube to Thanksgiving dinner. The cubes have become all the rage in the crypto world for their small size and surprising density.Shiba inu dog.Yuki Cheung/EyeEm/Getty3) I've been thinking about buying a shiba inu! (The puppy not the coin; I already have that).Demand for the Japanese hunting dogs has surged this year along with the price of meme coins like dogecoin and shiba inu coin. The cryptocurrencies, whose mascot is the shiba inu, have garnered the attention of the retail investing crowd, in addition to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and AMC CEO Adam Aron. Another shiba inu-based coin called Floki, a reference to Musk's new Japanese pup, has also joined the space. Be careful if you want to buy in, though, the cryptocurrencies — and the dogs — can be volatile.Story continues4) How's your home improvement project going with those crazy lumber prices?Inflation is at 30-year highs thanks to a bevy of factors like shortages, supply chain bottlenecks, and government stimulus checks, among others. The price of lumber, along with a lot of other costs, surged this year as first-time buyers joined the housing market and current homeowners made updates. More recently, lumber prices have since slumped from highs earlier in the year.5) I ordered my PS5 forever ago. One wrong turn in the Suez Canal, and I'm stuck with what I've got.In March, the Ever Given cargo ship became lodged in the pivotal waterway, prompting memes and adding to supply chain problems. After about a week blocking the canal, a fleet of tugboats and a dredger successfully freed the vessel.6) Have you seen my Facebook — ahem, the company formerly known as Facebook — posts lately?Facebook is no longer Facebook. In October, it rebranded to Meta as it plans to move into virtual reality and the future of the internet that has been dubbed the metaverse. Since then, the concept of the metaverse has become mainstream.Elon Musk.Picture Alliance/Getty Images7) Let's talk about voting! Did you vote yes or no on Elon Musk's poll to sell his Tesla shares?Musk posted a poll on Twitter on Nov. 6 asking if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla. The resounding answer was yes, and he's so far offloaded about $9 billion worth of shares. The Tesla chief's tweets have become increasingly influential this year, as his posts about digital assets, like dogecoin, bitcoin, and ethereum, have helped drive broad crypto rallies. On top of that, his own company has joined the $1 trillion club, and he's now the wealthiest man in the world.8) What did you think of Squid Game?The Netflix hit show that garnered more than 140 million viewers, according to Forbes, also inspired a cryptocurrency that soared in value in a matter of days in October. But it was a scam. The owners took their profits and the crypto went offline.9) How much did you make off Trump's SPAC?Blank-check companies known as SPACs were once a little known way for companies to go public, but during the pandemic they became wildly popular. Former president Donald Trump used one called Digital World Acquisition Corp. to take his company, Trump Media & Technology Group, public. DWAC shares quickly became a meme and surged in value on the news.10) Can someone please explain to me what a DAO is?It's a decentralized autonomous organization, better yet, it's just a bunch of internet friends getting together to accomplish a goal. One DAO bought the secretive Wu-Tang Clan album once owned by infamous pharma bro Martin Shkreli. Another tried to purchase the Constitution but was outbid by Citadel Securities' Founder Ken Griffin. Now one is trying to buy an NBA team.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 23, 2021, 10:23 AM"

LUNA, the native coin of Terra’s blockchain, ranks 14th as per market valuation. Leading centralized exchanges like Deribit do not offer option contracts tied to these coins.“We bought AAVE calls at $360 strike price sold by Ribbon Finance on Nov. 12,” said Sit. He also serves as an advisor to Ribbon Finance and ThetaNuts Finance.AAVE is the native token of decentralized lending-borrowing protocol Aave. The cryptocurrency was trading near $310 on Nov. 12 and changed hands near $274 at press time.QCP also bought bitcoin and ether calls and ether puts via Ribbon Finance on Nov. 12, generating a notional volume of over $200 million, Ribbon Finance co-founder Julian Koh said in a Telegram chat.“Covered call,” an options-trading strategy that leans neutral to bullish, involves selling out-of-the-money (OTM) call options – those with strike prices above the current spot price – while owning the underlying asset. A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market and pays a premium to the seller for offering protection against a price rally.Story continuesRibbon Finance covered call strategyWith Ribbon Finance, the covered call strategy is automated. Investors need to deposit their AAVE into the vault, which takes care of other complexities like selecting the appropriate strike level for selling the weekly option.The vault sells weekly AAVE call options against 100% of deposits every Friday at 11 a.m. coordinated universal time in return for the premium (paid in AAVE) by buyers, mostly consisting of market makers. The premium received represents the yield from the strategy and is distributed to users in proportion to their deposits.If AAVE expires below the strike at which the call is sold, the depositors retain the entire premium received. If the option expires in the money with AAVE settling above the call strike, the option buyer can purchase AAVE at the strike price, and depositors lose money.DeFi options tradingBy and large, the recently launched AAVE vault functions similar to Ribbon’s ETH and BTC-covered call vaults discussed in depth in September.Structured products offered by Ribbon Finance and other protocols like StakeDAO and ThetaNuts Finance yielding double-digit returns are becoming increasingly popular as returns decline from so-called cash and carry strategies.“DeFi options vaults are the key to scalability for options and structured products on DeFi,” QCP’s Sit told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “We see this as the real DeFi 2.0 wave.”Ribbon Finance has registered a volume of more than $2 billion since the launch of the first option vault in April, Koh said. ThetaNuts is planning to launch option vaults for BTC, ETH, ALGO, AVAX, LUNA, SPELL and several other cryptocurrencies on Dec. 3, protocol’s manager told CoinDesk in Telegram interview.","November 23, 2021, 10:25 AM"

Based on technical indicators, Bitcoin’s downside is capped at $53k, which suggests buyers will remain active towards $60K resistance.As part of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, strong dollar amid reports of an Indian Crypto ban trading volumes continue to decline. Although some analysts expect volatility to increase as November draws to a close in the bitcoin and ether options marketsPrices could move sharply over the next few days due to rising volatility, which could discourage buyers from holding onto positions for an extended period of time.Whales deposit Bitcoins at exchanges. Curiously, the exchanges have continued to outflow money, which has resulted in the reserves remaining near their lowest levels since mid-2018.In a report somewhat contradictory, Glassnode said long-term holders may not be spending as much as they were and are therefore more likely to be adding to positions than exiting them.There are two confluences on the chart from a technical perspective: the first is the 38% Fibonacci retracement level, and the second is the trendline that dates back to March 2020 and serves as support.Once the level is successfully backtested as support, it is possible that the uptrend will resume. On the other hand, the 50-day MA (*$60.6K), as well as $60K, seem to be the main immediate resistance levels.Bears might still have some runway left due to the constant trading volume during this correction. This calls for caution.As the RSI is making higher lows on the 4-hour chart, there are signs of bullish divergence, even though the RSI is falling on the daily time frame (but hasn’t reached oversold conditions yet).

Ether, on the other hand, on Wednesday managed to bounce off of its own such trendline.The second-largest token sees good round-number technical support at $4,000, according to Mike McGlone, a commodities analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It seems to be a battle with the leveraged longs from higher levels getting flushed and the longer-term, more institutional bid below the market,” he said. McGlone sees Ether consolidating its bull run within the $4,000 to $5,000 range.Cryptocurrencies have sold off in recent days amid a number of concerns, including greater regulatory risks as well as many tokens having run up very quickly in a short period of time. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which measures the performance of a handful of the largest tokens, has lost 14% so far this month.News that India is preparing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies appears to be behind the latest leg of the selloff in Bitcoin on Wednesday on exchanges popular with Indian investors. Bitcoin was down almost 14% at one point on WazirX while little changed elsewhere.Some analysts are also citing waning risk appetite in the broader equities market, where profitless technology companies have suffered the brunt of the declines.“We see Bitcoin come off in valuation when we see a selloff in the more speculative parts of the equity market,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said by phone.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Bitcoin lost as much as 3.1% to trade at $55,908, while Ether fell 4.2% at one point to $4,168.The important thing is that both Ether and Bitcoin held their lows from last week, according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Those lows -- $55,500 on XBT and $4,000 on XET -- are the more important short-term support levels.”Although Bitcoin has seen a sharp pullback within its intermediate-term uptrend, it is showing signs of short-term downside exhaustion per a number of indicators, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, an independent research firm focused on technical analysis. Plus, its oversold conditions increase the probability that it’s put a low into place.“We expect Bitcoin to resume its intermediate-term uptrend, allowing it to ultimately break out above resistance near $65K for a long-term measured move projection of $90K,” she wrote in a note.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t HelpingWildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the BenefitsHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in AmericaBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","November 24, 2021, 9:10 AM"

155,155.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rari-capital-fei-protocol-look-192817115.html,"Rari Capital, Fei Protocol Look to Overcome Bagholder Bias in Ambitious DeFi Merger","Last week, two major decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols proposed an ambitious merger that could create a lending-and-liquidity powerhouse.Untangling the details of how to combine two decentralized entities, however, is proving to be a complicated affair.On Nov. 16, Rari Capital co-founder Jai Bhavnani and Fei Protocol founder Joey Santoro each made a proposal in their counterpart’s governance forums: combine lending protocol Rari and stablecoin protocol Fei via a token merger agreed upon by each’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance.The joint protocols would immediately command over $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), provide a unique combination of stablecoin minting and money markets, and serve as a proof-of-concept for future DeFi mergers – a trend that was widely predicted to flourish at the end of 2020 but has largely failed to materialize due to inherent DAO complexities.Read more: xDai Wants a Gnosis Merger to Stay Relevant, but Some Tokenholders Are Crying Foul In Fei and Rari’s case, a number of factors stand in the way, including a pair of investor communities suspicious of one another, a token exchange rate that is the subject of some scrutiny and a number of details at the “social layer” that requires mutual trust.However, both teams believe not only that the merger is the best way forward for their respective protocols, but that they can also push it through.“This is not a done deal, but the core teams are committed to this,” Santoro said in a Fei community call last Thursday. “A treasury swap’s not good enough. We want to be fully incentive-aligned to do this together, to build really powerful integrations that aren’t just surface-level, and that only happens when you’re working under the same token.”SynergiesOn a surface level, a merger makes natural sense.The two protocols are already closely aligned. Many of Rari’s lending pools accept both Fei’s stablecoin, FEI, as well as the project’s TRIBE governance token, and this usage has allowed Fei to put its foot in the door of a stablecoin market largely dominated by USDC, USDT and DAI.Story continuesHowever, both teams believe a deeper integration could boost these synergies significantly.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Rari’s Jai Bhavnani framed the merger as one that could bolster Fei’s usage and simultaneously enable immediate liquidity in lending pools – an all-in-one combination of liquidity and utility as a service that few other protocols could match. Both teams declined to speak to CoinDesk, pointing instead to communication in public channels.“The question should be, ‘How is this going to create a bigger entity than us staying independent?’” said Bhavnani on the community call. “Us verticalizing all of DeFi, products like FEI bootstrap becoming a priority – I think everyone should get hyped up for this, because it’s going to be a complete game-changer.”In his post on Rari’s governance forum, Santoro said that Fei can help Rari solve oracle availability bottlenecks, and that both projects will encourage usage for one another, as well as for exotic, long-tail assets in the DeFi ecosystem seeking to bootstrap liquidity.“As more pairs begin to form against FEI, the network effects grow for Fuse and FEI to list more assets and more pools with more utility for each,” he wrote. Fuse is a Rari protocol for creating permissionless money markets.Community reactionBefore this vision can come to fruition, however, the teams need to convince token holders to vote for it.In the hours after the proposals were first posted, the initial reaction from investors was decidedly mixed as each community expressed concerns the other could weigh token prices down.As part of the proposal, Fei would issue TRIBE tokens in exchange for Rari’s RGT tokens at a $1 to $1 rate, as well as pay off Rari’s debts related to a previous hack.Read more: Rari Capital Reports Exploit in ETH Pool; $15M Taken“I want further discussion on this topic. I really love Rari, but I am not sure how I feel about assuming Rari’s hack liabilities,” wrote one user on Tribe’s governance forums.Other Fei community gripes focused on the market cap for RGT relative to TVL compared with other lending protocols, potential TRIBE dilution and the rate of RGT/TRIBE conversion.Likewise, on the Rari forums, RGT holders expressed similar concerns.“This proposal is so heavily weighted towards TRIBE that this feels like a scam proposal,” wrote one investor.However, many third parties came out in support of the merger, applauding both the natural match between the protocols and the ambition to attempt one of the largest DAO-on-DAO acquisitions in history.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The teams both said that initial mutual distrust from token holders makes sense.“The gut reaction was, ‘My bags are great and I don’t want to mix them with any other bags.’ What we’ve seen is that neutral parties or people who hold both TRIBE and RGT are absolutely fucking stoked about this, and it’s people who have one or the other and don’t understand the other community – they’re asking hard questions and pushing back,” said Fei’s Santoro.Likewise, Bhavnani framed many of the concerns in terms of bagholder bias – a term for when crypto holders grow overly fond of the assets they hold and often behave in a cultlike manner.“Each of our communities are extremely cultlike – and that’s fucking awesome. People sharing their feelings, people sharing their concerns, that means these are strong communities that care about these things, and that’s the best thing a DeFi project can ask for at this stage,” the Rari founder said.Bhavani said that both teams don’t want to “trivialize” concerns and that he hopes to work with both communities to rally investors around to the vision of a DeFi superpower.Hierarchy and administrationMerging DAOs additionally comes with a number of questions concerning hierarchy, workflow and decision making.When asked about who would serve as the leader or de-facto CEO of the joint venture, both founders pushed back against the notion of needing a clear leader at all.“I think that’s a really unfair question. Neither of us is running the protocol – it’s a DAO, and a DAO is going to be made of teams and different core contributors. It’s based on context and on token-weighted voting,” said Santoro.In practice, DAO organizations without a leader can sometimes stumble – Synthetix founder Kain Warwick had to re-enter a leadership role for the synthetic asset protocol after stepping away earlier in the year.Nonetheless, the teams argued that DAO incentive structures would be enough to ensure an orderly transition.“We have this one financial instrument that value-aligns these two teams. Technically, we don’t even have to talk to each other – we just can keep our heads down and we’ll both be working to maximize value for the token,” said Bhavnani.The best example of what that might look like in practice is MakerDAO. The stablecoin protocol disbanded its legal entity in 2021, and is now run by semi-cloistered core units.In the absence of a unified vision, MakerDAO governance proposals are often hotly contested, however.While to some that rancor may be a sign of dysfunction, some DAO experts say that disagreements – even heated ones – can be healthy.“If there are disagreements, that’s governance – I think [Compound governance contributor Getty Hill] put it beautifully on a Compound governance call, ‘Votes are passing too much, too damn much,” said Santoro.Details and decisionsWhile the initial proposals in the governance forums were short and to the point, a host of teams have stepped in to help flesh out the details.“I think it’s a really novel idea for you guys to merge, and I was looking at this package of, ‘How does this work? What does this mean? How does this functionally occur?’” Hill, also the founder of crypto development lab GFX, said on the Thursday community call.Hill noted that the merger requires a “lot of social consensus,” and GFX spent a day drafting a DAO merger agreement, filling out at a high level what was lacking in the proposals. The firm is now playing a key role in fleshing out the details of the merger.“We’re just trying to fill in all the points that no one thinks of, doesn’t want to talk about, or aren’t addressed with what we think is the most neutral way to proceed. We’re just here to help this thing along,” Hill addedThe team plans to make this template available to the communities as they look to move forward.Likewise, Llama, a DAO tooling organization, has stepped in to address the pricing of the RGT/TRIBE token transfer.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.In a post in both governance forums co-authored by a number of contributors, Llama founder Shreyas Hariharan proposed a dual transfer method: a 14-day time-weighted average price for RGT’s conversion to TRIBE, and a yearlong vesting “success token” that would allow holders to exchange RGT for TRIBE 50% above the TWAP price after a year.Despite the many moving parts and dangling loose ends yet to be addressed, both founders continue to express optimism regarding the success of the merger.Should all the complications be untangled, the end result could be the most successful instance of a DeFi merger to date – a key step in legitimizing DAOs as competitive organizational entities, and a possible template for consolidation in a notably fractured industry.","November 23, 2021, 11:28 AM"

The debt figure did not include the bitcoin bond recently announced, the IMF added.Among the measures to limit contingent fiscal liabilities, the IMF recommended El Salvador consider winding down the $150 million trust fund created to facilitate the exchange between bitcoin and U.S. dollars. It also recommended withdrawing public subsidies to Chivo Wallet, a digital wallet launched by the Salvadoran government on Sep. 7.Regarding the country’s new payments ecosystem, the IMF said that El Salvador must immediately implement “stronger regulation and oversight.”Story continuesIt added that the Chivo Wallet should be required to safeguard funds — in U.S. dollars and bitcoin — “by segregating and ring-fencing reserve assets.”The banking regulation, for its part, should add prudential safeguards such as conservative capital and liquidity requirements related to bitcoin exposure, the IMF added.El Salvador also must analyze the reporting of bitcoin-related transactions to determine how the cryptocurrency affects the Salvadoran economy and to closely monitor risks, the IMF said.","November 23, 2021, 11:42 AM"

Howe Institute said.“Canadian-dollar-linked stablecoins could become attractive to Canadians by making them convertible into cash issued by the Bank of Canada, and ensuring that stablecoins are well designed and regulated from business conduct, competitive, operational, privacy and prudential perspectives,” wrote Mark Zelmer and Jeremy Kronick, the authors of the report.A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price. Recently nominated vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Lael Brainard, has voiced her support for the potential advantages of a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC).Indirect CBDCSuch a feat by the Bank of Canada will require any potential stablecoins to be well designed and regulated to make them attractive to Canadians, Zelmer and Kronick wrote. The digital currency should also be issued in token form, with decentralized technology for settling transactions, allowing Canadians to retain most of the benefits of a paper currency, the authors added.“Our preference is for an ‘indirect CBDC,’ one that is allowed to pass over the balance sheet of payment providers, mimicking cash/banknotes on the Bank of Canada’s balance sheet today,” the duo said.The authors also highlighted that such adoption may incentivize private sectors to introduce Canadian-dollar linked stablecoins by enabling convertibility to cash to take place digitally, without relying on physical bank notes.On Feb. 25, Canadian bank VersaBank said it plans to launch a stablecoin “VCAD” which will be pegged to the Canadian dollar on a 1:1 ratio basis.A new chapterThe Bank of Canada adopting a digital currency that is convertible into Canadian dollars could usher in a new chapter in how Canadians pay for their goods and services. According to the report, however, this move can only be successful if there is a mass adoption by the consumers and there are infrastructures to support such use of digital currencies.“Canadians are more likely to favor those stablecoins if governments facilitate innovation in the payments world so that Canadians can benefit from ongoing advances in payments systems and crypto-technology, and the purchasing power of the Canadian dollar is maintained by keeping inflation low,” the authors concluded.","November 25, 2021, 10:21 AM"

Construction will be financed primarily by a $1 billion bitcoin bond issued on Blockstream’s Liquid network, a Bitcoin sidechain. Here’s how that may play out.Bd. Buenos dias. A stream of sunlight filters in from the eastern window in the luxury co-op that I’ve taken up residence in. The building, like many others in “Bitcoin City,” which is situated on the Gulf of Fonseca at the southeastern tip of El Salvador, erupts from the ground like a lightning bolt – a jagged architecture in reference to one of the city’s primary benefactors, Jack Mallers’ Zap.

It’s a modern church that towers above Satoshi Square, the central-most point of the city. From its bell tower, it’s said, you can make out the shadow of Solana Seastead, an experimental techno-kingdom floating 21 miles off the coast. We’re at war.Announced at the height of 2021′s “supercycle,” Bitcoin City is now half the age of the eponymous Bitcoin network. It’s the first and most developed crypto city, which isn’t saying much. Construction has been scattershot and slow going – more of a result of the competing interests of the municipality’s primary backers than of its unique financing. But we’re learning on the fly. The bitcoin bond, immediately graded “junk,” actually paid for itself – early investors are still getting a coupon payment.Story continuesSee also: Are El Salvador’s Bitcoin ‘Volcano Bonds’ an End Run Around the IMF? | The BreakdownWhat to build? Where to build it? An overriding commitment to the ideals of decentralization and self-sovereignty, and a lack of faith in the local government’s ability to allocate resources effectively, meant it was up for markets to decide. But finding consensus over the use of scarce resources is hard when the rules aren’t hard-coded. There’s plenty of money, but limited space and no zoning laws.Sure, there was a general architectural plan – a giant “b” bisects the city – but each building is a fiefdom of its own. People like it that way. Bukele’s government spent the proceeds of the $1 billion bitcoin bond to buy land and finance a conjoined, geothermal bitcoin mining facility and power station, but then the city mostly “decentralized itself out of existence.” That is, except for the state-run pet hospitals (it’s fine to throw the “Trojan horse” ruler a carrot).Promised residential areas, shopping centers, restaurants, “everything built around bitcoin,” we live with what the market provides. Some things are prioritized. Housing is either high-end or tiny, stacked hexagonal pods. There’s a McCafe on every block. It’s probably easier to buy a second passport than groceries. When the digital economy is paramount, and the population mostly globe-trotters, not many businesses can remain going concerns.Walking down the main thoroughfare of Bitcoin Boulevard, you’ll see holograms of Alexander the Great, Tony Robbins and Adam Back. There are a lot of figures who contributed to the city’s founding. A virtual projection of Bukele flickers outside City Hall, a neoclassical building cut out of orange and black stone. You can scan a QR code, deposit a satoshi or two, and he’ll tip his signature white baseball cap. Thanks for investing in the future.See also: The Future of Bitcoin: 12 Scenarios From Bullish to BearishThe whole idea of bringing in institutional dollars was shut down after Moodys downgraded the country. The only firms willing to buy distressed sovereign debt were the true believers – but as Blockstream’s Samson Mow said onstage at the “Feel the Bit” conference in 2021 – there are plenty of whales. But they all want a return on their tax-free investments.Although Bukele said, “Bitcoin City is committed to free and equal access to everything,” in practice that’s a little less true. Ideological libertarians may be willing to build a public library, but they’re less committed to public health care. The transient population, the limited VAT taxes actually collected and the lack of buyers for Salvadoran sovereign debt mean the country is living under austerity.I may sound pessimistic, but that’s only because you’re still living with the fiat mindset. A truly fair economic system recognizes that inflation is the greatest sin, that taxation is theft and that governments are hedonistic machines with a monopoly on violence. An economy based on scarce money makes sense for a world with limited resources, contrary to the last century of American hegemony.The startup cities that have been founded over the past odd decade present a new way for organizing the world. They treat citizens as customers, and what customers really want is a tax haven. It’s game theoretical, it’s inevitable, it’s as sure as the sun will set in the West.","November 23, 2021, 12:17 PM"

Based on technical indicators, Bitcoin’s downside is capped at $53k, which suggests buyers will remain active towards $60K resistance.As part of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, strong dollar amid reports of an Indian Crypto ban trading volumes continue to decline. Although some analysts expect volatility to increase as November draws to a close in the bitcoin and ether options marketsPrices could move sharply over the next few days due to rising volatility, which could discourage buyers from holding onto positions for an extended period of time.Whales deposit Bitcoins at exchanges. Curiously, the exchanges have continued to outflow money, which has resulted in the reserves remaining near their lowest levels since mid-2018.In a report somewhat contradictory, Glassnode said long-term holders may not be spending as much as they were and are therefore more likely to be adding to positions than exiting them.There are two confluences on the chart from a technical perspective: the first is the 38% Fibonacci retracement level, and the second is the trendline that dates back to March 2020 and serves as support.Once the level is successfully backtested as support, it is possible that the uptrend will resume. On the other hand, the 50-day MA (*$60.6K), as well as $60K, seem to be the main immediate resistance levels.Bears might still have some runway left due to the constant trading volume during this correction. This calls for caution.As the RSI is making higher lows on the 4-hour chart, there are signs of bullish divergence, even though the RSI is falling on the daily time frame (but hasn’t reached oversold conditions yet).

Ether, on the other hand, on Wednesday managed to bounce off of its own such trendline.The second-largest token sees good round-number technical support at $4,000, according to Mike McGlone, a commodities analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It seems to be a battle with the leveraged longs from higher levels getting flushed and the longer-term, more institutional bid below the market,” he said. McGlone sees Ether consolidating its bull run within the $4,000 to $5,000 range.Cryptocurrencies have sold off in recent days amid a number of concerns, including greater regulatory risks as well as many tokens having run up very quickly in a short period of time. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which measures the performance of a handful of the largest tokens, has lost 14% so far this month.News that India is preparing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies appears to be behind the latest leg of the selloff in Bitcoin on Wednesday on exchanges popular with Indian investors. Bitcoin was down almost 14% at one point on WazirX while little changed elsewhere.Some analysts are also citing waning risk appetite in the broader equities market, where profitless technology companies have suffered the brunt of the declines.“We see Bitcoin come off in valuation when we see a selloff in the more speculative parts of the equity market,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said by phone.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Bitcoin lost as much as 3.1% to trade at $55,908, while Ether fell 4.2% at one point to $4,168.The important thing is that both Ether and Bitcoin held their lows from last week, according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Those lows -- $55,500 on XBT and $4,000 on XET -- are the more important short-term support levels.”Although Bitcoin has seen a sharp pullback within its intermediate-term uptrend, it is showing signs of short-term downside exhaustion per a number of indicators, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, an independent research firm focused on technical analysis. Plus, its oversold conditions increase the probability that it’s put a low into place.“We expect Bitcoin to resume its intermediate-term uptrend, allowing it to ultimately break out above resistance near $65K for a long-term measured move projection of $90K,” she wrote in a note.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t HelpingWildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the BenefitsHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in AmericaBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","November 24, 2021, 9:10 AM"

The company also built a team focused on acquisitions and new businesses, Bloomberg added.“Demand for our services varies from nation to nation,” Dagnoni told Bloomberg, noting, for example, that Mexico has significant demand for remittance services while Argentines prioritize U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins due to the volatility of the local peso.In June, Mercado Bitcoin raised $200 million in a Series B round from the SoftBank Latin America Fund at a $2.1 billion valuation.

""Invest here and earn all the money you want,"" he told the euphoric crowd.Supporters have hailed Bukele's plans - including making bitcoin legal tender in September - saying they would bring jobs, financial inclusion and foreign investment to one of the Western Hemisphere's poorest countries.""Feel the Bit"" read the giant screen before Bukele - who brands himself ""CEO of El Salvador"" on Twitter - came on stage.But some in El Salvador and beyond expressed outrage at the glitzy event in a nation beleaguered by inequality, violence and poor public services.""This video makes me sick, angry and sad at the same time,"" said Marce, twitter user @_lamismadeayer.The government says the issuance of $1 billion in ""Volcano bonds"" in partnership with Blockstream - a digital assets infrastructure company - would provide development funds. El Salvador currently faces a $500 million budget gap for next year according to credit rating agency Fitch.But the bitcoin bond is not designed to cover that gap.Half of the bond money would go to infrastructure, including for building Bitcoin City, with the remainder used to purchase bitcoin and locked up for five years. After the lock up, the bitcoin can be sold, generating a capital return that will be split 50-50 between the government and investors, only after the initial $500 million are recouped, according to the plan.Story continuesThe 10-year bitcoin bond offers a 6.5% coupon, payable yearly, but another Salvadoran bond that matures in 2032 is currently yielding close to 13.9%.Financial markets have reacted warily. The spread of Salvadoran yields to safe-haven U.S. Treasuries has widened sharply since late April. This week it added an extra 79 basis points and sits above 1,200 bps, its widest ever.Investors sold off El Salvador's bonds in May after the Bukele-controlled Congress fired the attorney general and five Supreme Court judges, who were replaced with loyalists, critics say.The 2025 bond yields more than 18%, according to Refinitiv data. With such a high cost, the country is effectively excluded from borrowing on the market.Graham Stock, senior sovereign analyst at Blue Bat Asset Management, said government funding through bitcoin could discourage El Salvador from adopting sustainable spending policies, adding the country would likely continue to need International Monetary Fund support.""Building the economy around crypto mining and attracting crypto businesses is an untested strategy to put it mildly,"" he said, adding Bukele did not appear to have plans to increase growth and tax revenues. IMF TALKS STALLEDTalks with the IMF for a $1 billion loan have stalled amid concerns over a lack of transparency and the price volatility of cryptocurrency, as well as fears of democratic backsliding as Bukele consolidates power. But many in the cryptocurrency community are upbeat, saying the bond will harness strong retail demand.""Bitcoin bonds are a game-changer in fixed income markets,” said Moritz Wietersheim, founder of Specter Solutions, a bitcoin security and product company.Although bitcoin has fallen about 16% from its record high of $68,990.90 this month, it remains up over 90% this year.""Bitcoin Week"" marked the first time the digital currency experiment was stress-tested by international crypto evangelists.As vendors hawked ""Jesus Loves Bitcoin"" shirts, panel discussions grouped crypto currency leaders and Salvadoran ministers. Excitement was widespread at having a 'petri dish', as many attendees called El Salvador’s experiment.Several attendees aired worries about the government's Chivo wallet, where Salvadorans can send and receive bitcoin - highlighting tensions over a state tool for a currency created as an alternative to government financial systems.Pre-loaded with $30 for users and backed by a $150 million fund, Chivo allows users to make transactions to other Chivo users fee-free, but registration requires Salvadorans to enter their ID numbers and other personal information while transactions are kept on a ledger.Some attendees described Chivo as a gateway to independent bitcoin wallets, such as Muun or BlueWallet, that offer privacy.""When I make a payment, in the notes section, I write ‘use Muun, don’t use Chivo,’"" said Wietersheim, using the hashtag #FixChivo on Twitter.Since its rollout, Chivo has been criticized for thousands of cases of fraud and money disappearing from wallets.Several programmers said that for the speed of implementation - less than four months after Bukele announced it at a June conference - these technical problems were normal.Bukele has blamed high demand for the issues. A spokesperson for the president's office and Chivo could not be reached for comment.(Additional reporting by Rodrigo Campos in New York; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Aurora Ellis)","November 24, 2021, 11:18 PM"

176,176.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/two-two-partners-city-las-143000553.html,TWO TWO Partners with the City of Las Vegas,"Invigorating the Downtown Arts District with physical, virtual and NFT artLas Vegas, NV, Nov. 24, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- (via Blockchain Wire) TWO TWO and the City have partnered to invigorate the Downtown Arts District. With immersion, interaction, NFTs and multiple forms of reality, TWO TWO’s collaborations with some of the world’s finest artists, composers and engineers are representative of the inspiration behind creativity, focusing on the expansion of artistic vision and disrupting the entire industry. Reimagining mediums, TWO TWO transcends all current artist experiences. As the entertainment capital of the world, Las Vegas recognizes the need to exhibit art in a manner that remains relevant to future generations.“TWO TWO is a perfect partner to help us re-invigorate our Arts District to attain world class status,” according to Tammy Christensen, Senior Economic Development Officer of the City of Las Vegas. “We look forward to hosting the transformation of the art world happening in our amazing City.”As the bohemian jewel of downtown Las Vegas, the Arts District is already prominent. An absolute Mecca of food, music, fashion, and of course art, the area is home to the city’s most exciting venues, boutiques, restaurants, bars, and art galleries, serving up the best culture Southern Nevada has to offer. From the hippest bars like ReBar, which is a combination of a bar and antique shop where literally EVERYTHING is for sale, to the most delectable restaurants like Esther’s Kitchen, founded by Michelin five-star chef James Tree, the Arts District is the true cultural hub of Las Vegas. “Everything about the Arts District is independent and free-spirited,” says Trees. “Unlike the big hotels on the strip, where everything fits nicely into a theme, the Arts District is its own entity. That’s what makes it so fun and exciting.”You can shop for the most vibrant modern and vintage fashions at places like Glam Factory Vintage and Del’la Couture, or enjoy the best theater this side of Broadway at The Cockroach Theater or the Vegas Theater Company. Cocktail lounges like The Velveteen Rabbit and high-brow coffee shops like Makers and Finders are more New York Soho chic than Vegas Strip kitsch, and craft breweries like HUDL Brewing and Able Baker are making names for themselves by churning out the tastiest and most unique craft brews in the country. Popular venues such as Ninja Karaoke offer up a full throttle Tokyo karaoke experience, with themed rooms that are perfect for hosting your next birthday or business party, while trendy salons like The Atomic Lounge can give you the most stylish classic looks from the 1950s to today.Story continuesBut of course, what would the Las Vegas Arts District be without the art.You don’t even have to set foot in one of the district’s many remarkable galleries in order to peruse the murals that beautify the walls of almost every building in the area. Whether in search of a limited-edition print, the perfect piece to tie a room together, or the ideal artist to bring a custom commission to life, the Arts District’s galleries are treasures troves for both the casual and serious art lover alike. The Arts Factory is a sprawling converted warehouse that serves as home to the city’s most celebrated local artists’ studios, and Helios Fine Art is another renowned venue known for pushing boundaries and challenging the viewer.For those seeking vintage collectibles, furniture, knickknacks, and tchotchkes, Retro Vegas is a total time machine of Vegas kitsch, specializing in the best remnants of the bygone era. Still, perhaps the most exciting aspect of this burgeoning Vegas cultural phenomenon is their renowned First Friday events. On the first Friday of every month, the Arts District hosts a huge block party where the city’s best musicians, artists, food vendors, and clothing designers come together to showcase their trend-setting work. It is the best party in town. Although best known as a monthly event, the First Friday Foundation extends its community outreach efforts well beyond the first Friday of each month.As a non-profit organization, the First Friday Foundation serves to empower local arts, culture, and education through artistic opportunities for thousands of students in the Clark County School District. This directly aligns with TWO TWO’s own mission statement, to connect and enrich the global community through arts and entertainment. As the first immersive art gallery in the district, TWO TWO will become the touchstone from which all future galleries and art will emerge. So forget your tired old Las Vegas strip, and welcome yourself to the city’s best kept secret, located in the southern downtown within walking distance to Fremont St.“If you want to learn about history, you could read history books but that's a single perspective that may be tainted by class or politics,” according to Steven W Meistrich, Co-Founder and CEO of TWO TWO. “In my opinion, if you really want to understand and embrace history, one needs art, music and literature because that represents truth; the heart of a society, a generation, a culture. That understanding, offers a true sense of the meaning of history which is fundamental to the grown of humanity. Art, music and literature are not erudite. They are oxygen and it is incumbent upon us to educate.”TWO TWO, the City of Las Vegas, partners in Art Without Boundaries.ABOUT TWO TWOTWO TWO is the world’s first Interactive Art Gallery. It blurs the boundaries between physical and virtual art, exhibiting and selling the works of visionary, established and emerging graffiti, pop and street artists.

There are, however, ways to expose yourself to Ethereum without actually buying any tokens. These three look pretty interesting — one might be worth trying with some of your spare change.Coinbaseaskarim / ShutterstockAs the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the U.S., Coinbase is in prime position to benefit from a rise in Ethereum trading, earning a transaction fee on every sale or purchase.Many cryptocurrencies sold on the exchange are powered by the Ethereum blockchain, which means a bet on Coinbase is essentially a bet on Ethereum itself. Their futures are tightly linked.One thing you want to see in any stock is a capacity for growth, and Coinbase has that in spades. In the second quarter of 2020, Coinbase had 1.5 million monthly users; a year later, that figure hit 8.8 million. Over that same span, net revenue grew from $178 million to $2.03 billion.Coinbase’s stock, currently trading for around $314, is down about 4% since the company went public in April.(And by the way, while many exchanges charge hefty commission fees to buy and sell crypto, some investing apps charge 0%.)Robinhood MarketsWachiwit / ShutterstockLooking at Robinhood’s stock performance since its IPO launched in July — it’s down more than 20% — you may wonder if the meme stock juice that the company was running on is fizzling.Story continuesIt’s a fair question, but Robinhood is not just a commission-free stock trading platform. The discount broker has facilitated Bitcoin and Ethereum trading since way back in 2018, and it now allows users to buy and sell Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.Robinhood’s crypto offerings have been paying off for the company too. Crypto-generated revenue in Q2 2021 was $233 million, more than 40 times what it was a year before.HIVE BlockchainCrypto mining farm | Mark Agnor / ShutterstockA cryptocurrency miner, HIVE Blockchain is one of the many companies that turn colossal amounts of computing power into crypto tokens. HIVE mines Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.The amount of energy required to mine cryptocurrency is creating environmental concerns among prominent investors, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and HIVE is focused on using green energy for its mining.HIVE has plans to pivot and focus on other cryptocurrencies once Ethereum 2.0 is rolled out, but its business is still heavily reliant on Ethereum and should provide decent exposure to Bitcoin’s little brother in the near to mid-term.HIVE investors have had a great 2021. The company’s stock has more than doubled in price since the beginning of the year.If any of these ideas interest you, know that you don’t have to start big. These days, you can build your own crypto-related portfolio just by using digital nickels and dimes.Avoid crypto volatility altogether—and still come out aheadKvitka Fabian / ShutterstockCrypto investing isn’t for everybody. The wild price swings and the many, many questions about its future as a currency make it a risky play in the short and long term.If the crypto market is a no-go for you, and you believe the stock market looks ready for a plunge, it might be time to get a piece of some real assets, like commodities or productive American farmland.Another option is contemporary art, which has solidly outperformed the S&P 500 almost every year since 1995.Investing in modern masterpieces doesn’t require millions of dollars. With the help of a popular new app, you can buy shares in rapidly appreciating works by Claude Monet, Andy Warhol and even Banksy.You won’t be able to gaze at them on your wall, but seeing them in your portfolio should be just as inspiring.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

Three Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee -- Jon Tester (D-Mont.) Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) -- reportedly told the panel chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), in a call on Wednesday they would not support Omarova's nomination.According to Axios, John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) also oppose the nomination. Without the backing of all Democrats, it would be nearly impossible for Omarova to get confirmed in an evenly split Senate. ""The White House continues to strongly support her historic nomination,"" a White House official told the news outlet.""Saule Omarova is eminently qualified for this position,"" the official added. ""She has been treated unfairly since her nomination with unacceptable red-baiting from Republicans like it's the McCarthy era.""Senate Republicans have gone after Omarova, who was raised in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan, for a past paper she wrote while at Moscow State University, saying it raises questions about her support for capitalism. ""She wants to nationalize the banking system, put in place price controls, create a command and control economy where the government allocates resources explicitly, instead of free men and women making their own decisions about the goods and services they want to buy and sell in an open market,"" Sen. Pat Toomey (Pa.), the top Republican on the Banking panel, said at her nomination hearing. ""These are exactly the kind of socialist ideas that have failed everywhere in the world they've been tried.""Other Republicans called Omarova ""comrade"" while she was questioned at the hearing.Democrats have said Republicans are trying to paint Omarova as a communist sympathizer, with Brown saying the line of attack is a ""cruelty no person should experience.""""I grew up without knowing half of my family. My grandmother herself escaped death twice under the Stalin regime,"" Omarova said at the hearing. ""This is what seared in my mind. That's who I am.""The Hill has reached out to the five Senators reportedly opposing Omarova's nomination, Brown and the White House for comment. ","November 25, 2021, 5:57 AM"

Subscribe for free.Their opposition also hints at a willingness of some Democratic senators to buck the White House on an important nomination, even if it hands Republicans a political — and symbolic — victory.Republicans have attacked the Kazakh-born scholar in remarkably personal terms, and turned her nomination into a proxy battle over how banks should be regulated.Driving the news: In phone call on Wednesday, Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), all members of the Senate Banking Committee, told Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) — the panel's chairman — of their opposition.They're joined in opposing her by Sens. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.).The five senators' offices either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Go deeper: Biden officials also have heard directly from the senators. They're aware of their deep opposition and know Omarova faces nearly impossible odds for confirmation.Still, they continue to back her publicly.""The White House continues to strongly support her historic nomination,"" a White House official told Axios.""Saule Omarova is eminently qualified for this position,"" the official said. ""She has been treated unfairly since her nomination with unacceptable red-baiting from Republicans like it’s the McCarthy era.""Omarova tried to salvage her candidacy during a hearing last week, where Republicans savaged her for her previous academic writings about how community banks should be regulated.Story continuesHer nomination, reflected in an ugly hearing in which Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) questioned whether he should call the native of the former Soviet Union ""professor"" or ""comrade,"" became a proxy battle.It split between the banking industry and progressives eager to impose more regulation on it.""The OCC charters, regulates and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations, as well as federal branches and agencies of foreign banks,"" it says on its website.The big picture: Now that the president has stared down progressives by renominating Jerome Powell for another term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, ideological fights between centrists and progressives about economic appointments are going to become more pronounced.Progressives like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have already indicated they'll work to oppose Powell.Warren does support another Biden move, elevating Fed governor Lael Brainard to the vice-chair position.With centrists like Tester getting their preferred Fed candidate nominated for a second term, they may feel more emboldened to challenge the White House on lower-level nominations.Like this article?

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said consumers and investors may not understand how stablecoins work and the risks involved.“I have significant concerns with the non-standardized terms applicable to redemption of particular stablecoins, how those terms differ from traditional assets, and how those terms may not be consistent across digital asset trading platforms,” Brown wrote in his letter to Circle, the payment services company that operates stablecoin USD coin (USDC).After publication of this article, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted that he was looking forward to “responding and working with you to ensure consumers are appropriately protected.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Brown also sent letters to cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and Binance.US, as well as blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos, which operates the USDP stablecoin; decentralized finance company TrustToken, which operates the TUSD stablecoin; and Centre, the Coinbase- and Circle-founded project that oversees the USDC stablecoin.The report compiled by the President’s Working Group, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is the first step toward establishing federal-level regulatory oversight of the stablecoin sector in the U.S.The regulators behind the report called on Congress to bring stablecoins under federal supervision. The report indicated that should lawmakers fail to do so, the regulators themselves may step in through the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which could designate stablecoin activities “systemically important” and thus subject to tighter supervision.Story continuesRead more: US Stablecoin Report Gets Mixed Reviews From Crypto IndustryStablecoins are cryptocurrencies typically tethered 1:1 to the value of other assets like the U.S. dollar, and issuers maintain the fixed value of these currencies by backing them with reserves that match the value of the coins in circulation.

However, if the level of $56,000 gets broken by the bears, eyes will be on the $53,500 zone.Story continuesThis article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:European Equities: German Business Sentiment and U.S Economic Data in FocusCrude Oil Price Update – Trend Down, Momentum Up; Strenghtens Over $79.29, Weakens Under $78.09Ethereum, Litecoin, and Ripple’s XRP – Daily Tech Analysis – November 24th, 2021Shiba Inu Coin – Daily Tech Analysis – November 24th, 2021ASX200: A Quiet Economic Calendar Leaves Commodities and COVID-19 News in FocusThe Crypto Daily – Movers and Shakers – November 24th, 2021","November 23, 2021, 4:06 PM"

WhaleAlert has recently reported a purchase of over 850 billion Shiba Inu coins, but this move also failed to provide material support to Shiba Inu.It looks that the interest in the coin is fading which is natural since Shiba Inu has been moving lower since late October, when it reached all-time high levels near $0.000090. Shiba Inu has already lost more than half of its value in less than one month, so traders’ interest in the coin is declining.Crypto markets are very dependent on momentum. According to CoinMarketCap, almost 15,000 cryptocurrencies exist in the world. While most cryptocurrencies are not available on major exchanges, traders still have plenty of options to choose from so they tend to move from one coin to another depending on the near-term trends.Not surprisingly, recent data from Google suggests that search interest in Shiba Inu coin is declining. Trends change quickly in the crypto world, and only the leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, managed to stay at the top of traders’ wishlists. The interest in other cryptocurrencies is often volatile, and they quickly move back and forth in rankings.At this point, it is obvious that Shiba Inu needs additional upside catalysts to break the current downside trend. Whale transactions failed to provide enough support to the cryptocurrency, and it needs to get back on the “hype train” to attract more traders.Technical AnalysisShiba Inu has recently made an attempt to settle above the resistance at the 50 EMA at $0.004245 but failed to develop sufficient upside momentum and moved back below the $0.000040 level. Currently, Shiba Inu is trying to settle below this level.Story continuesRSI remains in the moderate territory as Shiba Inu moves lower without huge sell-offs, so there is plenty of room to gain additional downside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.In case Shiba Inu manages to settle below the $0.000040 level, it will move towards the next support level which is located at the recent lows near $0.000036.A move below $0.000036 will push Shiba Inu towards the support at $0.000033, although it can also get some support near the $0.000035 level. If Shiba Inu declines below $0.000033, it will move towards the support at $0.000032.On the upside, a move above $0.000040 will push Shiba Inu towards the resistance at the 50 EMA. In case Shiba Inu manages to settle above the 50 EMA, it will head towards the next resistance level at $0.00004450. A successful test of this level will open the way to the test of the resistance at the 20 EMA near $0.000047.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Trying to RecoverGBP/USD Price Forecast – British Pound Continues to Look SickShiba Inu Keeps Moving Lower As Whale Transactions Fail To Provide Enough SupportBitcoin Price Prediction – Avoiding sub-$57,000 Would Bring $60,000 into PlaySAND Soars Over 260% In November While Metaverse is on FireStripe is Open to Accepting Crypto Payments Again","November 25, 2021, 1:20 AM"
188,188.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/next-shiba-inu-shib-retail-183152064.html,What Next for Shiba Inu (SHIB) as Retail Interest Ebbs?,"On the 28th of October, joke coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) hit a market capitalisation of above $54B. At the time, the price per coin reached an all-time high of just over $0.00008. That marked a near 2000% gain from the start of the month when the cryptocurrency’s price per coin was under $0.00001 and its market cap under $3.0B.The surge in Shiba Inu valuation went hand in hand with a rapid rise in retail interest in the coin. According to google trends, overall search interest in the term “Shiba Inu” surged by more than 30 times between the end of September and 27th of October. Similarly, over the same time period, Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric rose from under 20K to above 500K.Retail interest fadesBut as indicators of retail trader interest in the meme coin have faded in the subsequent weeks, SHIB’s price has gradually pulled back. According to google trends data, by the 23rd of November, overall search interest in “Shiba Inu” has dropped more than by 10 times compared to the record high on the 27th of October. Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric also pulled back to under 70K by the 23rd of November.Meanwhile, over the same time period, SHIB has come under pressure. The coin is now down over 50% from the late October record highs and trades just above $0.0004. That means its market cap has dropped to around $24B, according to TradingView.This is not the first time we have seen SHIB rise and fall in tandem with a rise and fall in retail investor interest in the meme coin. Recall back to May, when SHIB jumped from under $0.000002 to near $0.000035, a more than 20 fold increase in value, in a matter of days, before then sharply dipping back under $0.00001 (where it then stayed until October). That spike in valuation also coincided with a sharp uptick in search interest, according to google trends.What next for SHIB?Clearly then, if SHIB is to regain its mojo and head back to record levels, the retail trading/investing community is going to have to start getting excited about it again. Here the signs are tentatively promising. On Thursday the 25th of November, Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric lept back above 100K from close to 60K the day before. Similarly, in the last five days, their Social Engagement metric has risen from under 60K (a near-one-month low) to above 120K, a more than three-week high.Story continuesSHIB might be showing early signs of responding to this uptick in interest. The coin rose more than 20% in value on Thursday the 25th of November and is threatening a technical break above a downtrend that has suppressed the price action for the whole of November.Should SHIB break to the north of this level and should an acceleration in the coins gains rekindle retail trader/social media excitement about the coin, SHIB could be looking at some rapid gains back towards its prior record highs.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:S&P 500 Price Forecast – Futures Markets Quiet in Thin Holiday TradingNatural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Quiet During Holiday TradingGermany’s New Multi-party Government to Raise Investment but Maintain Fiscal DisciplineGold Price Forecast – Gold Markets Stable on ThanksgivingUSD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis – Convincing Breakout Over 115.615 Puts 118.601 – 118.658 on the RadarWTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+","November 25, 2021, 10:31 AM"

The second major support level at $54,550 should limit the downside.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Natural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Rise Ahead of Inventory ReportE-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Technical Analysis – Strong Over 35908, Weak Under 35679SPDR MSCI USA StrategicFactors ETF (QUS) Remains Strong Despite Recent DipBest Buy Down by 14% Despite Reporting Better-Than-Expected EarningsEthereum, Litecoin, and Ripple’s XRP – Daily Tech Analysis – November 24th, 2021Gold Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Market Prices in Rate Hikes","November 23, 2021, 4:23 PM"

Grayscale estimated that revenue from virtual gaming worlds could grow to $400 billion in 2025, from around $180 billion in 2020.Yet Grayscale, which runs the world's biggest cryptocurrency fund, said the metaverse is still ""in its early innings."" It said Facebook's plans to spend $10 billion this year on the metaverse is a sign of the potential of the market.""The market opportunity for bringing the Metaverse to life may be worth over $1 trillion in annual revenue,"" the report said, although it did not specify a timeframe.The report's authors, Grayscale's head of research David Grider and research analyst Matt Maximo, argued the metaverse is a huge opportunity for crypto companies.Story continuesRead more: The metaverse won't revolutionize the office. But it might create new ways of earning money.Many current metaverse projects, such as virtual realities or games, are run by so-called Web2 companies, which are centralized and operate for profit. Facebook, which has launched the virtual reality space Horizon Worlds, is an example.But increasingly, metaverse projects are created on or are heavily tied to crypto technology, which can give users more control and allow them to earn money that they can use in the real world. This is known as the Web3 metaverse.Grayscale listed the opportunities for monetization of consumers within the Web3 metaverse. These include art galleries launching NFTs, games and casinos where players win crypto, digital advertising billboards, and music venues where DJs and artists hold concerts.In the third quarter, total Web3 and NFT fundraising hit $1.8 billion, out of overall crypto fundraising of $8.2 billion, Grayscale said. It added that investment has ""recently started to accelerate.""Grayscale's report focused on Decentraland. In that metaverse, people log in to play games, earn the native cryptocurrency mana, purchase NFTs including virtual land and collectibles, and vote on the governance of the economy.The crypto investment company recently created a Decentraland trust that invests solely in mana. The cryptocurrency is up around 550% in the last 30 days, according to Coingecko.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 25, 2021, 4:30 AM"
194,194.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrency-currency-future-142000578.html,Is cryptocurrency the currency of the future?,"For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberationIn this news cycle, cryptocurrency seems to be the only thing anyone is talking about. It seems society has suddenly propelled back to the future as we have seen nations start to adopt a phenomenon known to many as crypto — the world’s newest medium of exchange.The best way to describe crypto is as the digital currency it is, thinking of the many different types of cryptocurrency as currencies with different utilities. The one quality that they all share is that they contribute to the creation of a richer digital experience.The Bitcoin logo appears on the display screen of a cryptocurrency ATM at the Smoker’s Choice store in Salem, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)The challenging part is understanding that cryptocurrency fluctuates rapidly and can be volatile — sparking the interest of investors and micro-investors throughout the world who are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. Some experts believe cryptocurrency is all about timing and crypto-believers argue that cash and the USD is archaic and truly the inferior form of currency … but are these investors right?It is impossible to demystify the secret of cryptocurrency without answering the infamous question — what is blockchain? Often discussed in tandem, many mix up the idea of cryptocurrency with blockchain, and others simply don’t know the difference.Blockchain is a decentralized technology that is incredibly secure (think of the root of the word crypto — as in encryption). The benefit of blockchains is that its technology is spread across many different computer operating systems, thus arguably making them more secure than existing payment systems.Easily accessible crypto-wallets like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Gemini, have made it easy to buy and sell over 50 different cryptocurrencies. Gemini is particularly interesting because of its founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who started the company in 2014.If you ever watched The Social Network, you will remember the Winklevoss Twins — the two brothers that infamously founded HarvardConnection, a social media network on Harvard’s campus that predated Facebook. Although the Winklevoss brothers seemed to have lost the Facebook war, they continue to prove themselves as formidable opponents to Mark Zuckerberg in the “Metaverse”— going on to found one of cryptocurrency’s leading exchanges.Story continuesHowever, while the Winklevoss brothers have used this and their other investments to propel them into the billionaire stratosphere along with their rival Zuckerberg — cryptocurrency has always had a different meaning for Black and Brown people.For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberation. In this case, it comes as no surprise that Black people have been, by and large, leading the cryptocurrency boom. The University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center reports that 46% of cryptocurrency holders are people of color — with 18% of those holders being Black. These numbers make sense considering the deep seated distrust in the Black community surrounding government regulation and the wealth gap.The Bitcoin logo is displayed on the side of a Bitcoin ATM on November 10, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)To many, cryptocurrency will serve as the great equalizer that education was once viewed as in this country. Accessibility is another reason for cryptocurrency’s success within the Black community. Investors can purchase cryptocurrency at a painfully low entry point — you only need a dollar to buy crypto as you can fractionally invest in currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum buying a minute fraction of the coin.This enables folks with less disposable income to get in on the fun whereas the stock market has traditionally excluded these population groups. But cryptocurrency has implications that span far larger than just Black America. Cryptocurrency has also become a force to be reckoned with on the forefront of the global community. This has left many economists asking the question of what crypto means for the global economy?Akon was perhaps one of the first celebrities to openly discuss cryptocurrency and its ramifications, as early as 2018, when he declared his own cryptocurrency, Akoin. Akon noted that this cryptocurrency would guide Africa into financial freedom and be the basis upon which his futuristic city would be built.If Akon’s plan does succeed, it would liberate the Senegalese people from the French-backed CFA (the national currency of Senegal and many Francophone countries in West Africa). But Senegal isn’t the only African country interested in cryptocurrency. Nigeria has quickly grown to be the second largest market for crypto trading, following the United States.Akon attends the Jingle Bell Ball at the O2 Arena on December 5, 2010 in London, England. (Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)Many Nigerians have found the use of cryptocurrency as a solvent way to protect their money against the depreciation of the Naira (which is linked to the USD.) Moreover, cryptocurrency simplifies the transference of remittances (money sent back home by nationals or family members who live internationally) and minimizes costs and fees. The issue of remittances is a phenomenon that can be seen throughout the African continent and across the pond in the Caribbean and Latin America as well.El Salvador has led the Latin American community in cryptocurrency, becoming the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. Both President Nayib Bukele and Maria Luisa Hayem, El Salvador’s Minister of Economy, are proud to have led Latin America into this innovative economic revolution. Despite their efforts, adoption has been slow, with only 12% of consumers using cryptocurrency since the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in September.Yet not all countries have bought into the hype, with China banning all crypto-related transactions and deeming them illegal. Crypto economist and attorney Jamar Montgomery thinks it’s because “open source cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are a threat to a government’s control over a monetary and financial system.”While these governments desperately cling to the little financial control they have left — the rest of the world seems to be moving toward a new age. With even the infamous Los Angeles Staples Arena being renamed and rebranded to reflect a new moniker, “crypto.com,” it is certainly reflective of the new age of cryptocurrency.Wen-Kuni Ceant, theGrio.comWen-kuni Ceant is the CEO and Co-Founder of Politicking.

This support level has already been tested several times and proved its strength. In case Bitcoin manages to settle below $56,000, it will likely gain strong downside momentum which will be bearish for the whole crypto market.Other cryptocurrencies are under pressure today. Shiba Inu has finally managed to settle below the support at the 50 EMA at $0.00004265 and declined towards $0.000039. Dogecoin moved to the support level at $0.22 after an unsuccessful attempt to settle above $0.2350. Solana pulled back towards the $216 level while XRP moved back below $1.05.It looks that crypto traders are waiting for clues from Bitcoin, which is stuck in the $56,000 – $57,700 range. In case the world’s leading cryptocurreny manages to get above $57,700 and develops upside momentum, other coins should also rebound.Technical AnalysisEthereum continues its attempts to settle above the resistance at the 20 EMA at $4,290. The bulls have quickly bought all recent pullbacks and pushed Ethereum back towards the 20 EMA level.However, the general crypto market sentiment has been mostly bearish in recent days, so Ethereum failed to develop sustainable upside momentum.In case Ethereum manages to settle above the 20 EMA, it will move towards the resistance at $4,535. A move above this level will push Ethereum towards the resistance at $4,650. In case Ethereum gets above $4,650, it will head towards the resistance at $4,770.On the support side, Ethereum needs to settle below the support level at $4,100 to have a chance to test the 50 EMA at $3,975. A move below the 50 EMA will signal that Ethereum is ready to develop additional downside momentum. In this case, Ethereum will move towards the next support at $3,715. In case Ethereum declines below this level, it will head towards the next support level which is located at $3,580.Story continuesFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Ethereum Pulls Back As Crypto Markets RetreatCrude Oil Rampages Past One Week HighPre-Thanksgiving Economic Data Puts the Greenback and the U.S Economy in the SpotlightElon Musk Disses Binance CEO on Dogecoin GlitchGold Bugs Face Danger From U.S Federal Reserve BankIMF Warns El Salvador Against Using Bitcoin as Legal Tender","November 24, 2021, 12:02 AM"

200,200.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rising-fees-avalanche-trigger-scramble-092052966.html,Rising Fees on Avalanche Trigger Scramble for Solutions,"Transaction fees are a touchy subject in crypto.First there was Ethereum, with simple trades on Uniswap going for over $100, as of Nov. 23, according to Etherscan. Now, in the wake of a weekend Twitter war in which transaction fees played a central role, users are reporting on the social network that fees on Avalanche, another Layer 1, are creeping up as well.“Avalanche transaction fees for swaps up to $20 tonight,” tweeted Eric Conner, co-founder of EthHub, the Ethereum information resource. Conner’s screenshot shows a transaction interacting with the router contract of Trader Joe, the decentralized exchange (DEX) on Avalanche.Fees for the contract have declined since then — they’re hovering in the $1.50 range as of Nov. 23, though swaps with transaction fees as high as $5 have occasionally appeared throughout the day.Two ReasonsKevin Sekniqi, COO and chief protocol architect of Avax Labs, which supports development on Avalanche, cited two reasons for the spikes in fees. The first is a 10M gas hardcap applied every 10 seconds, which Sekniqi told The Defiant is “an ultra-conservative measure that makes blockspace on Avalanche even scarcer than Ethereum mainnet.”Gas is a unit which measures computational effort required for transactions on the blockchain. So the gas limit is how much computation effort is available in a given timeframe. As demand for computation on a blockchain goes up, given a fixed gas limit, transactions get more expensive.“As blockspace is consumed within these 10 seconds, the fees aggressively ratchet up to prevent the rapid creation of blocks in a very condensed time period to spam the networking layer,” said Sekniqi. The ratcheting up is a unique mechanism to Avalanche and leads to temporary spikes in fees, according to the protocol architect.The second primary factor driving up fees is MetaMask, the crypto wallet, which has struggled to estimate Avalanches fees due to the unique mechanism, said Sekniqi. The protocol architect said that the gas limits will be removed following the introduction of something called superpruning, which essentially allows some of the blockchain’s history to be discarded. “It’ll be much faster and cheaper than Ethereum on apples to apples,” Sekniqi said.Story continuesCrypto Maxi, a pseuodonymous investor and developer, is skeptical of how much superpruning will help lower fees. “Pruning directly doesn’t influence scalability,” they told The Defiant.While it’s unclear how much superpruning help lower transaction fees, Sekniqi does say that Avalanche will need a technology called subnets to get “infinite scalability.”Subnets are a horizontal scaling strategy that can validate Avalanche blockchains running in parallel.SuperpruningThere too, Crypto Maxi is skeptical. “Subnets do not share security unlike Polkadots parachains,” they said. “Technically they will help Avalanche scale the same way as if there would be a bunch of Matic-type chains launched around Ethereum.” The developer concedes subnets are superior to sidechains.Overall, Sekniqi is optimistic about the combination of superpruning, subnets and other optimizations, saying that “together, [the technologies] will dramatically increase the scalability of Avalanche, and thereby the broader DeFi ecosystem as it grows out of the crypto niche and into mainstream.”Crypto Maxi thinks the breakthroughs haven’t happened yet. “Nothing offers orders of magnitude performance increases, unless we talk about stuff like zkRollups etc,” the developer said.There’s no doubt that Avalanche is attracting users at a rapid rate. The platform hit an all-time high of 669,756 daily transactions on Nov. 21, according to block explorer Snowtrace.Daily transactions on Avalanche’s c-chain. Source: SnowtraceThat’s more than half of the mark Ethereum hit on the same day — the world’s largest smart contract platform had 1,260,939 transactions on Nov. 21.Of course, both platforms could tweak their parameters to increase scalability and lower transaction fees, but that means there will be more expensive hardware requirements for the nodes processing the transactions, which dampens decentralization.In all, it’s setting up to be a battle for the ages.Read the original post on The Defiant.","November 24, 2021, 1:20 AM"
201,201.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shib-slumps-large-holders-profits-191933336.html,SHIB Slumps as Large Holders Take Profits,"Shiba inu, the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, may still have its passionate following but it was in the red again Wednesday, following three consecutive weeks of losses.The loss followed profit-taking by large SHIB token holders, as the crypto market moved to a risk-off mode, a situation when traders reduce their exposure to riskier assets, according to blockchain data.“Crypto markets are currently in a risk-off mode following the new highs made by bitcoin and ether [about] two weeks back,” blockchain analytics firm Nansen said in a written response to CoinDesk, adding that it’s “natural to see higher beta assets like SHIB to dip in price as investors de-risk.”At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.0000370, down 11.89% in the past 24 hours, according to Messari.According to Nansen, an increasing number of wallets with significant holdings have been reducing their SHIB positions recently, possibly due to profit-taking.Data from blockchain data firm Santiment shows similar trends. So-called whale transaction counts, or the number of SHIB transactions valued more than $100,000, have been rising since the beginning of November. Active deposits, or the amount of daily unique addresses to deposit SHIB to centralized exchanges, have also been increasing.Large valued SHIB transactions vs. SHIB's price. (Santiment)A spike in the active deposit metric may indicate a rise in short-term sell pressure for the token, according to Santiment’s metric explainer.“Like any asset, SHIB price is the product of supply and demand ... a larger percentage of SHIB buyers were evidently attracted by its speculative appeal alone,” Rick Delaney, a senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. “Drawn by the asset’s rising price, many SHIB investors simply do not have the long-term conviction needed to hold their positions or to reenter the market while the price is dropping.”Falling trading volumeWhile SHIB was once the most traded token on centralized exchanges, its trading volume has dropped significantly, as CoinGecko’s data shows.Story continuesNansen said that trading volume is among the most important metrics for SHIB and other meme tokens because a drop in trading volume shows that investors start to lose interest and become more “cautious” of putting money in the meme-themed tokens.The most traded alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on centralized exchanges now are gaming-related tokens, including decentraland (MANA) and the sandbox (SAND), according to CoinGecko.“SHIB’s price fall can be mostly attributed to the recent shift in investors’ interest from meme tokens to metaverse projects,” crypto price-tracking site CoinMarketCap wrote in a response to CoinDesk. “That can easily be seen by comparing the trading volume of MANA, SAND and SHIB.“Trading volume is always related to investors’ interest in a project,” it added.Social media buzz around the canine-themed coin has also sunk dramatically. At the time of publication, Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge retail interest in trending topics, showed a value of 22 for the search query “SHIB” globally, down from a peak at 100 at the end of October.A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time. A value of 22 means fewer people are scanning the web for information on SHIB.Silver liningDespite declining social media buzz around the meme token, retail investors’ interest in SHIB remains strong as the number of unique addresses holding SHIB continues to increase – good news for the SHIBArmy.The number of unique addresses holding SHIB surpassed one million on Nov. 11 – a time when SHIB’s prices were already dropping, according to Nansen data.“Retail interest is definitely there still, as people take speculative bets,” Daniel Khoo, research analyst at Nansen, said. “[No one] wants to miss out on getting rich.”","November 24, 2021, 11:19 AM"

208,208.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrency-currency-future-142000578.html,Is cryptocurrency the currency of the future?,"For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberationIn this news cycle, cryptocurrency seems to be the only thing anyone is talking about. It seems society has suddenly propelled back to the future as we have seen nations start to adopt a phenomenon known to many as crypto — the world’s newest medium of exchange.The best way to describe crypto is as the digital currency it is, thinking of the many different types of cryptocurrency as currencies with different utilities. The one quality that they all share is that they contribute to the creation of a richer digital experience.The Bitcoin logo appears on the display screen of a cryptocurrency ATM at the Smoker’s Choice store in Salem, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)The challenging part is understanding that cryptocurrency fluctuates rapidly and can be volatile — sparking the interest of investors and micro-investors throughout the world who are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. Some experts believe cryptocurrency is all about timing and crypto-believers argue that cash and the USD is archaic and truly the inferior form of currency … but are these investors right?It is impossible to demystify the secret of cryptocurrency without answering the infamous question — what is blockchain? Often discussed in tandem, many mix up the idea of cryptocurrency with blockchain, and others simply don’t know the difference.Blockchain is a decentralized technology that is incredibly secure (think of the root of the word crypto — as in encryption). The benefit of blockchains is that its technology is spread across many different computer operating systems, thus arguably making them more secure than existing payment systems.Easily accessible crypto-wallets like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Gemini, have made it easy to buy and sell over 50 different cryptocurrencies. Gemini is particularly interesting because of its founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who started the company in 2014.If you ever watched The Social Network, you will remember the Winklevoss Twins — the two brothers that infamously founded HarvardConnection, a social media network on Harvard’s campus that predated Facebook. Although the Winklevoss brothers seemed to have lost the Facebook war, they continue to prove themselves as formidable opponents to Mark Zuckerberg in the “Metaverse”— going on to found one of cryptocurrency’s leading exchanges.Story continuesHowever, while the Winklevoss brothers have used this and their other investments to propel them into the billionaire stratosphere along with their rival Zuckerberg — cryptocurrency has always had a different meaning for Black and Brown people.For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberation. In this case, it comes as no surprise that Black people have been, by and large, leading the cryptocurrency boom. The University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center reports that 46% of cryptocurrency holders are people of color — with 18% of those holders being Black. These numbers make sense considering the deep seated distrust in the Black community surrounding government regulation and the wealth gap.The Bitcoin logo is displayed on the side of a Bitcoin ATM on November 10, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)To many, cryptocurrency will serve as the great equalizer that education was once viewed as in this country. Accessibility is another reason for cryptocurrency’s success within the Black community. Investors can purchase cryptocurrency at a painfully low entry point — you only need a dollar to buy crypto as you can fractionally invest in currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum buying a minute fraction of the coin.This enables folks with less disposable income to get in on the fun whereas the stock market has traditionally excluded these population groups. But cryptocurrency has implications that span far larger than just Black America. Cryptocurrency has also become a force to be reckoned with on the forefront of the global community. This has left many economists asking the question of what crypto means for the global economy?Akon was perhaps one of the first celebrities to openly discuss cryptocurrency and its ramifications, as early as 2018, when he declared his own cryptocurrency, Akoin. Akon noted that this cryptocurrency would guide Africa into financial freedom and be the basis upon which his futuristic city would be built.If Akon’s plan does succeed, it would liberate the Senegalese people from the French-backed CFA (the national currency of Senegal and many Francophone countries in West Africa). But Senegal isn’t the only African country interested in cryptocurrency. Nigeria has quickly grown to be the second largest market for crypto trading, following the United States.Akon attends the Jingle Bell Ball at the O2 Arena on December 5, 2010 in London, England. (Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)Many Nigerians have found the use of cryptocurrency as a solvent way to protect their money against the depreciation of the Naira (which is linked to the USD.) Moreover, cryptocurrency simplifies the transference of remittances (money sent back home by nationals or family members who live internationally) and minimizes costs and fees. The issue of remittances is a phenomenon that can be seen throughout the African continent and across the pond in the Caribbean and Latin America as well.El Salvador has led the Latin American community in cryptocurrency, becoming the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. Both President Nayib Bukele and Maria Luisa Hayem, El Salvador’s Minister of Economy, are proud to have led Latin America into this innovative economic revolution. Despite their efforts, adoption has been slow, with only 12% of consumers using cryptocurrency since the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in September.Yet not all countries have bought into the hype, with China banning all crypto-related transactions and deeming them illegal. Crypto economist and attorney Jamar Montgomery thinks it’s because “open source cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are a threat to a government’s control over a monetary and financial system.”While these governments desperately cling to the little financial control they have left — the rest of the world seems to be moving toward a new age. With even the infamous Los Angeles Staples Arena being renamed and rebranded to reflect a new moniker, “crypto.com,” it is certainly reflective of the new age of cryptocurrency.Wen-Kuni Ceant, theGrio.comWen-kuni Ceant is the CEO and Co-Founder of Politicking.

The government will have certain exceptions that would promote the underlying technology and its uses.According to the Times of India, ‘The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill 2021’ is one of the new bills that were introduced and are currently being considered. This latest development comes as the Reserve Bank of India starts working on launching and issuing its digital currency.The publication said, “The Bill also seeks to prohibit all private cryptocurrencies in India. However, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrencies and its uses.”At the moment, the RBI is examining the feasibility of launching its own central bank digital currency (CBDC) but hasn’t decided on a date to launch the pilot project.Indian Government Continues to Attack CryptocurrenciesThe RBI has clamped down on cryptocurrencies numerous times over the past few years, but the crypto community in India has fought back and won numerous times. The RBI banned cryptocurrency exchanges from operating in India roughly a year ago, a move that led to some crypto trading platforms to exit the Asian country.However, the Supreme Court of India overturned the decision and lifted the ban on crypto exchanges earlier this year. Thus, allowing crypto exchanges to operate and thrive in India. The regulatory uncertainty in Indian continues to affect the cryptocurrency market in the country as investors are not sure how the government will view the assets in the long term.The Indian government has come out to state that it is looking at a progressive regulation of cryptocurrencies, pointing out that an unregulated market cannot be allowed to operate due to the risks of money laundering and other vices.Story continuesThe government is currently in talks with the cryptocurrency and blockchain organizations in India to determine the best way to regulate Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The outcome will be huge due to India’s place as one of the leading cryptocurrency countries in the world. This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Lowe’s Builds on Big MoneyGBP/JPY Price Forecast – British Pound Continues Consolidation Against YenIMF Warns El Salvador Against Using Bitcoin as Legal TenderAccenture Continues to Attract Big MoneyAUD/USD Price Forecast – Australian Dollar Continues to Break DownBig Money Fuels WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Growth","November 24, 2021, 2:43 AM"

By 2030, these users will be behind $17 billion in annualised Lightning payment volume and more than 1.2 billion.”According to Félix Ulloa, the vice president of El Salvador, an unnamed Swiss company offered to buy the country’s Bitcoin stash at $50,000 a unit, regardless of the daily market value, which avoids the issue of volatility as a whole.    ","November 25, 2021, 1:15 AM"

Howe Institute said.“Canadian-dollar-linked stablecoins could become attractive to Canadians by making them convertible into cash issued by the Bank of Canada, and ensuring that stablecoins are well designed and regulated from business conduct, competitive, operational, privacy and prudential perspectives,” wrote Mark Zelmer and Jeremy Kronick, the authors of the report.A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price. Recently nominated vice-chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, Lael Brainard, has voiced her support for the potential advantages of a central bank-issued digital currency (CBDC).Indirect CBDCSuch a feat by the Bank of Canada will require any potential stablecoins to be well designed and regulated to make them attractive to Canadians, Zelmer and Kronick wrote. The digital currency should also be issued in token form, with decentralized technology for settling transactions, allowing Canadians to retain most of the benefits of a paper currency, the authors added.“Our preference is for an ‘indirect CBDC,’ one that is allowed to pass over the balance sheet of payment providers, mimicking cash/banknotes on the Bank of Canada’s balance sheet today,” the duo said.The authors also highlighted that such adoption may incentivize private sectors to introduce Canadian-dollar linked stablecoins by enabling convertibility to cash to take place digitally, without relying on physical bank notes.On Feb. 25, Canadian bank VersaBank said it plans to launch a stablecoin “VCAD” which will be pegged to the Canadian dollar on a 1:1 ratio basis.A new chapterThe Bank of Canada adopting a digital currency that is convertible into Canadian dollars could usher in a new chapter in how Canadians pay for their goods and services. According to the report, however, this move can only be successful if there is a mass adoption by the consumers and there are infrastructures to support such use of digital currencies.“Canadians are more likely to favor those stablecoins if governments facilitate innovation in the payments world so that Canadians can benefit from ongoing advances in payments systems and crypto-technology, and the purchasing power of the Canadian dollar is maintained by keeping inflation low,” the authors concluded.","November 25, 2021, 10:21 AM"

Bitcoin’s use as legal tender “also gives rise to fiscal contingent liabilities” the IMF added.The international financing institution, which reviews the fiscal, monetary and external position of its member states annually, recommended “narrowing the scope of the Bitcoin law” and “strengthening the regulation and supervision of the new payment ecosystem”.The IMF said that El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s announcement of a $1B “bitcoin-bond” over the weekend had not been discussed in its meetings with the government. But the Article IV concluding statement cautioned that the government’s plans would “require a very careful analysis of implications for, and potential risks to, financial stability”.El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tenderIn September, El Salvador adopted bitcoin as its second form of legal tender to go alongside the US dollar. The dollar has been the country’s main form of money since it ditched its old national currency, the colón, back in 2001 after two decades of double-digit inflation.El Salvador thus became the first country in the world to adopt bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, as a form of legal tender, creating excitement in the crypto community and drawing ire from critics in equal measure.With bitcoin now a form of legal tender, economic agents are legally mandated to accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment for services unless some form of technical impediment exists. The El Salvadorian government introduced a new e-wallet called Chivo which facilitates both US dollar and bitcoin transactions, as well as conversions between the two, and is backed by a $150M government trust fund.On Saturday, President Bukele announced that El Salvador would build the world’s first “bitcoin city” at the base of the Conchagua volcano, where bitcoin mining would be powered by geothermal energy and there would be no taxes, aside from VAT. The city would initially be funded by the issuance of a $1B bond, the proceeds of which would be invested into bitcoin, a so-called “bitcoin bond”.Story continuesIMF recommends stronger regulation, oversight“Stronger regulation and oversight of the new payment ecosystem (the Chivo e-wallet) should be immediately implemented for consumer protection, anti-money laundering and counter financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), and risk management”, the IMF recommended in its statement on Monday.“Banking regulation should incorporate prudential safeguards such as conservative capital and liquidity requirements related to Bitcoin exposure”, the group added. “Measures to limit fiscal contingent liabilities, such as winding down the trust fund or withdrawing public subsidies to Chivo, should also be promptly considered”.Bukele’s announcement of a new bitcoin city backed by bitcoin bonds has not been able to turn the tide for BTC/USD, which continues to trade heavily on Tuesday in the mid-56,000s. For now, support at in the 55,700 area is holding up well, but the cryptocurrency continues to post lower intra-day highs, signaling the likelihood of a downside break. That would open the door to a test of support in the form of the mid-October lows in the 54,000 area and then at the 7 September high just under 53,000.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Accenture Continues to Attract Big MoneySilver Price Daily Forecast – Silver Remains Under Pressure As Dollar Gains More GroundBig Money Fuels WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings GrowthWhy Gap Stock Is Down By 23% TodayRipple CEO Believes SEC Case will be Concluded Next YearGold Price Forecast – Gold Trying to Break Through Major Uptrend Line","November 24, 2021, 3:55 AM"

The company also announced that it would be delisting Tron’s TRX.“The regulatory landscape for crypto is evolving rapidly… As a result, we will be limiting the ability for US users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX” a spokesperson from eToro told Business Insider.The surprise delisting triggered selling in ADA. The cryptocurrency now trades more than 5% down on the week, with its market cap having tumbled from above $61B at the start of the week to under $58B as of Thursday.As of the 26th of December 2021, eToro US users will no longer be able to buy the cryptocurrency. Then, after the 31st of December 2021, users holding ADA will no longer be able to earn staking rewards.In a video response to the decision, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, blamed the decision on a lack of regulatory clarity and played down the impact the delisting would have on ADA’s price in the long term.He explained that European-based exchanges like eToro tend to limit their US exposure, given that US exposure comes with high regulatory costs. US-based exchanges like Coinbase, which are already paying for US regulatory compliance, have an easier in the US, he added.About Cardano and its Cryptocurrency ADACardano is an open-source, decentralised blockchain platform that achieves consensus using proof-of-stake and can facilitate internal transactions using its cryptocurrency ADA.It was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, and was initially funded through an initial coin offering (ICO). In 2017, Cardano launched its crypto-currency ADA.Story continuesADA is the largest cryptocurrency (by market capitalisation) to use a proof-of-stake blockchain. Proponents of proof-of-stake blockchains argue that it is significantly more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.Back in February, Hoskinson estimated that the Cardano network used just 0.01% of the energy used by the Bitcoin network.ADA Back Sharply from September’s Record HighsADA surpassed $3.0 in September, taking its gains on the year at the time to more than 1700%. Since the all-time highs printed two months ago, however, the cryptocurrency has seen a sharp correction.As of Thursday, with ADA trading in the mid-$1.700s, the cryptocurrency is down more than 40% from its prior record highs. But the cryptocurrency still trades with on-the-year gains of more than 800%.As regulatory concerns build and the broader crypto market continues to struggle, further profit-taking may see ADA drop back towards the next key area of support in the $1.0 area, which would amount to a further 40% correction.But between April and July this year, the $1.0 area proved to be a profitable area for short-term buyers on four different occasions. There is every chance this buy-the-dip mentality could return.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Trying to RecoverWTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+USD/JPY Price Forecast – US Dollar Continues to Press Ever so HigherTesla Shares Rally Despite Musk Selling Over $1 Billion of His StakeAUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis – Taking Out .7170 Could Trigger Acceleration into .7106Natural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Quiet During Holiday Trading","November 25, 2021, 5:50 AM"

Dubbed the “crypto sprint,” the agenda sketches out a to-do list for 2022 that will offer crypto players more clarity on the rules of the road, and comes as the industry is moving to shape the debate.“Cryptocurrencies didn’t grow big because of this lack of protection or lack of regulation. Binance has grown to be the biggest cryptocurrency exchange in the crypto industry because we protect our users and the users trust us,” Zhao told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.Like its more U.S. focused competitor Coinbase (COIN), Binance has recently laid out its own recommendations for crypto oversight, in the form of a bill of rights for cryptocurrency investors.“We believe it should be up to each nation’s policymakers and their constituents to decide who should have oversight over the industry,” the bill states.While he admitted that cryptocurrency is still nascent, Zhao added that “I think the industry has grown to a point where there are many smaller players who are less protective of their users and we would like to see more regulation in the space so the retail consumers are protected.”Big profits, governance headachesBitcoin's taken another leg lower since setting a fresh record on November 10.Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has earned record-breaking profits this year as cryptocurrencies surged when Bitcoin (BTC-USD) cracked a new all time high earlier in November, hitting levels just below $69,000. The notoriously volatile digital coin market has had a rough week, with Bitcoin shedding over $10,000 from its record. Zhao insisted his company was wrapping up its latest round of funding “in about a month or two,” as he tries to smooth over Binance's friction with regulators, who are trying to make sense of the asset class — and provide effective investor protections.Story continuesMeanwhile, the exchange’s U.S. subsidiary, Binance.US, has seen a revolving door of three different CEOs this year alone. Catherine Coley was replaced in April by the former acting head of the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks — who left to head the crypto infrastructure and banking company after only a few months on the job.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.More recently, Binance.US promoted Brian Shroder to CEO and hired Amjad Qaqish — another former regulator from the IRS’ Criminal Investigations unit (IRS-CI) — to lead its compliance division. Amid the executive turmoil, the exchange's token, Binance Coin (BNB), has become the third largest cryptocurrency after BTC and ethereum (ETH-USD).

The coin, which is based on an internet meme of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog, was the most-googled in 23 states, including Florida, Illinois and Michigan.This year, it shot to prominence, thanks in large part to the Twitter-based cheerleading of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who is a known crypto enthusiast that holds dogecoin, bitcoin and ether. Musk even went so far as saying in May this year that he might accept dogecoin as payment for his company's electric vehicles.By that point, dogecoin was already beloved among the army of Reddit retail traders, who had pushed the coin up to around $0.07, from closer to $0.007 at the start of the year and Musk's payment remark sent the price to a record $0.70.

233,233.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cardano-tron-sink-as-etoro-slaps-limits-on-both-citing-evolving-cryptocurrency-debate-172946749.html,"Cardano, Tron sink as Etoro slaps limits on both, citing 'evolving' cryptocurrency debate","Cryptocurrencies Cardano (ADA) and TRON (TRX) sank on Wednesday, following a decision by online trading platform eToro to delist the digital coins on its platform — a move that left crypto market watchers flummoxed.TRON tumbled by over 5% on the day, while Cardano has sold off by over 8%, according to market data.In a terse statement, the exchange based its decision on unspecified regulatory reasons, but it comes at a time when authorities are moving to exert more control over the crypto sector, in a bid to protect investors. “The regulatory landscape for crypto is evolving rapidly. As a result, we will be limiting the ability for U.S. users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX,” said an eToro spokesperson.Starting December 26, users won’t be able to open new positions in either coin, and their ability to receive a yield for staking those same assets will end on December 31.While eToro assured customers they will not be forced to sell their existing holdings in those cryptocurrencies, both assets came under selling pressure since the announcement. eToro did not specify exactly what concerns prompted the move.   Mati Greenspan, CEO of investment research firm Quantum Economics, told Yahoo Finance that he couldn’t immediately identify which U.S. regulations affect ADA and TRX that don’t also apply to the rest of the crypto market.“As a user and former employee I support their decision but a bit more clarity into their train of thought would be appreciated by the community,” said Greenspan.'Unclear' motivesCardano tumbled after a crypto platform moved to limit trading in the digital coin.The wide reaching effort to rein in what Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has called the ""Wild West"" of digital currencies has stirred uncertainty in the crypto sector. It's led to some market players scrambling to influence the debate over regulation — and others to try and get out ahead of possible enforcement actions, which could be driving eToro's thinking.The SEC classifies Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) - the two largest cryptocurrencies - as commodities instead of securities, but most cryptocurrencies sold on exchanges to U.S. investors aren’t registered as such.Story continuesExpressing his personal views numerous times since taking office as the SEC’s head, Gensler has said that many crypto assets — especially those that fall in the Decentralized Finance or DeFi space — are 'Decentralized In Name Only (DINO)’. That means the SEC could very well begin to take enforcement action on crypto exchanges that offer these assets.In December 2020, the SEC announced that it would sue another top cryptocurrency, Ripple (XRP). While the lawsuit is ongoing, roughly 80 different cryptocurrency exchanges at least briefly de-listed XRP according to Carol Goforth, a Law Professor at the University of Arkansas who specializes in securities and crypto regulation.“That is where I have seen most of the de-listing that has occurred, but it's not clear yet that’s what is going on here,” Goforth told Yahoo Finance.Like stablecoins, crypto lending or offering customers the chance to earn “staking rewards” has drawn scrutiny from regulators. In September, the SEC cut short Coinbase’s efforts to launch their own lending service, with Gensler insisting that the product offering needed to be registered as a security. Meanwhile, crypto lenders BlockFi — reportedly under investigation by the SEC — and Celsius Network have faced numerous cease and desist orders from state securities regulators.There are a number of reasons why an exchange might want to “de-list” a cryptocurrency for U.S. consumers according to Goforth. But she could not determine any unique characteristic of ADA or TRX which would make them a target for regulators. Underscoring the opaqueness of eToro's decision, Bitstamp — a far larger exchange — just recently listed Cardano for trading, which made the move to limit trading ""particularly confusing, unless eToro knows something that we don’t,” said Goforth. Conversely, “Tron has a relatively high trading volume, but again, I don’t see anything that makes it particularly likely to be a target for regulators.”Goforth suggested eToro might have also be using an “internal reviewing” process that points to these assets being riskier, or more likely to be the targets of regulatory attention.David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

I think it's not necessary that everybody has to invest in crypto,"" Zhao said on Yahoo Finance Live. ""My mom doesn't use the internet that much and that's fine. The internet is fine.

He is super successful which I respect a lot. We don't need to get him into crypto. He used a flip phone based on a couple years ago. I get worried if he uses crypto, he may not have the necessary skills or the knowledge on how to keep his own crypto safe.""Buffett has been a vocal critic of crypto, famously calling it ""rat poison"" in a 2018 interview. Buffett's righthand man Charlie Munger called bitcoin ""disgusting and contrary to the interests of civilization"" at Berkshire's annual meeting earlier this year.Story continuesWhile Zhao praised Buffett's investing acumen, he had sharper words for another member of the billionaire club. ""Well, I don't intend to be sassy on Twitter...

So much so that the singer and reality star shared a throwback clip from her family show, “Braxton Family Values.”“Where are the freakin chitterlings for God’s sakes?!” Tamar wrote in the caption of an Instagram post on Tuesday, Nov. 23. “How can there be Thanksgiving without them!! Please help us @trinabraxton1 and I need em BAD.”The funny clip features Tamar, her mother, Evelyn Braxton, and her sister Towanda Braxton shopping at the grocery store.“Tamar, you for real gonna’ eat chitlins?” asked Towanda asked in the video before Tamar responded, “Yes, girl, you for real not?” Towanda countered with, “No, that’s disgusting.”“Chitlins are a good way to bring a family together, even though they stank a little bit. But if you pull the membrane out it’s just fine, and that’s exactly what my mama does. So I don’t know what Towanda is talking about, but she shole ate the hell out them thangs just like I did.”The clip also sees Tamar playfully annoying Towanda, which ultimately annoys their mother. “Those girls know they worked on my last nerve,” added Evelyn.While standing in the check-out line, Evelyn then tells Tamar she couldn’t eat “skinny popcorn,” to which Tamar responded, “Well don’t eat nothing then.”Evelyn’s head immediately does a 180 turn to say to her youngest daughter, “Who you think you talking to?” Of course, Tamar said, “Nobody,” but mama was not having it.“I think you better get your act together,” said Evelyn, while Tamar added, “K.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Fans in the comments enjoyed the hilarious “Braxton Family Values” clip, including Evelyn’s grandson, T oni Braxton‘s oldest son, Diezel Braxton, who calls her “MomMoms.”“I’m sorry but MomMoms moment for real has me in tears,” Diezel wrote, while another individual said, “Mama Evelyn does not play.”Many went back and forth explaining how hard it was to find chitterlings, including one who notified Tamar, “its a shortage on [ chitterlings] this year.”Story continuesOthers called for Tamar to share the entire “Braxton Family Values” clip, which ends with Towanda paying for the groceries herself. “You left the best part out when you and Ms. @evelynbraxton left and had @itowandabraxton pay for it,” wrote one fan with laughing emojis.Meanwhile, many praised Evelyn for checking Tamar on how she talked to the “BFV” matriarch.“Y’all better quit playing with momma,” one individual said, while another wrote, “Who you think you talking to! NOBODYYYYY. [You] were hilarious!!!!! I need the show to come back!”Many began to petition for We TV’s “Braxton Family Values” to return for its eighth season, including some who said, “Y’all were the funniest folks on tv.”One person added, “I love momma E! Miss seeing her on TV.”“I miss the shenanigans,” wrote another.Despite cutting ties with We TV last year, Tamar Braxton appeared in the seventh season of “Braxton Family Values,” which documented her purported suicide attempt in July 2020.Tamar previously accused We TV of using her pain to boost the show’s ratings and made other claims about the series she’s been a part of since 2011 during an episode of her “Under Construction” podcast in November 2020.“I created ‘Braxton Family Values.’ I created that show and funded it, OK? Let me go there,” said Tamar. “I know everybody is like, ‘Well, your sisters have to work and your sisters have to do this that and the other.’ Well, yeah, I know this because I created it.”“Braxton Family Values” has maintained one of the top slots on We TV since its premiere in 2011.

Elo Gimenez, ConsenSys’ global public relations lead, would say only: “ConsenSys is committed to building the digital economy of tomorrow and also to complying with U.S. law in all its facets. That commitment is reflected in our terms of service.”The switch underscores the latent tension between sanctions, a policy tool to isolate rogue regimes, and blockchains, decentralized networks unconstrained by geographic borders. While sending money from the U.S. to Iran is clearly prohibited, simply teaching citizens of a sanctioned country to use censorship-resistant technology is a more ambiguous matter.The suspensions come two months after Ethereum developer Virgil Griffith pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge in a sanctions case brought by the U.S. over a speech he gave at a conference in North Korea. Griffith was previously expected to fight the charge in court.Story continuesLong-tense relations between the U.S. and Iran were further strained this month after two incidents in the Sea of Oman.ConsenSys has been raising money over the course of 2021: The VC-backed entity got a fresh $65 million in April and $200 million in November, with mainstream finance heavyweights such as Mastercard, HSBC and UBS among the investors.Whatever the reason for ConsenSys Academy’s decision, it left the students, who lost access to the course materials a few weeks before the program’s scheduled ending on Dec. 1, frustrated and bewildered.“We are not entering a genuinely new world, but we are just witnessing a transition of our old institutional relations, which are the relations of inequality and power, to just new forms and institutions,” one of the students, Salman Sadeghi, a researcher at the College of Dublin in Ireland, wrote in an emotional blog post.Recent college graduate Mohammad Hosein Ahmadzadeh told CoinDesk that being abruptly cut off from ConsenSys Academy felt like a bitter deja vu: websites like Coursera and GitHub have previously restricted access for users from Iran.“Especially when [Donald] Trump was president, Iranians couldn’t use these sites,” Mohammad added. “We can’t access any education sites with Iranian IP or nationality.”Gray areaWhen asked whether, as a general matter, sanctions bar U.S. companies from teaching blockchain programming to Iranians, a Treasury Department spokesman said: “this isn’t something answered by a simple yes/no.”“We’d need to really have an extensive compliance discussion with the company itself in order to make any kind of assessment,” said the spokesperson, Morgan Finkelstein, declining to comment further.Sanctions experts interviewed by CoinDesk gave differing opinions on the risk of violating sanctions for U.S. companies that provide education to Iranians and the potential severity of any penalties.While education is normally not subject to the sanctions the U.S. imposed on Iran, there are some intricate caveats, said Benjamin Hutten, counsel at the law firm Buckley LLP.For example, it’s only legal to provide learning materials that are a complete product, available in full from the start. This means that “it would probably be permitted to export books, pre-recorded courses or lectures,” but not teach a live lecture, for example, via Zoom, because it “would not be fully in existence at the time of the sale,” Hutten said. (ConsenSys Academy’s course included live content, according to a person familiar with the program.)It’s easier with traditional learning formats, when to study with an American teacher one needs to go through the emigration process and effectively get approved as a foreign student by the U.S., Hutten said. Accredited academic institutions, like universities, can provide remote courses to Iranian students if those students previously had a U.S. student visa and the coursework was part of regular degree studies, Hutten said.“If a company can keep [its] crypto educational activities within the above constraints, there should be relatively low risk in doing so,” he said. If not, the consequences can be either a significant monetary penalty or even criminal charges for a willful violation, Hutten said.Given the exemption under sanctions law for informational materials, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) “has not been in the habit of publicly penalizing companies providing education or educational materials to Iran, and it certainly has not imposed severe penalties in this sphere,” Hutten said.However, the agency “has discretion to make the penalty fit the circumstances, and thus to the extent that the information or education could be or is used to violate or evade stations, the penalties could be more severe.”Read more: ConsenSys AG Shareholders Readying Legal Action Over Share ValuationDaniel Tannebaum, a former OFAC officer and partner at the Oliver Wyman consulting firm, told CoinDesk that the language of sanctions laws can be confusing to people who don’t regularly deal with them, and “confusion about potential non-compliance can force businesses to abandon what could potentially be lawful activities.”Although the case of Virgil Griffith apparently scared people in the industry, Tannebaum said he believes that spreading knowledge about blockchain technology and digital assets is not damaging, but helping what the U.S. is trying to achieve in Iran.“Blockchain and digital assets may benefit the government of Iran, but they also benefit the Iranian population in breaking out of their existing banking system as they try to look for more freedom, assuming broader sanctions relief,” Tannenbaum said. “That being said, the sanctions are still heavily in effect. So if you find that you’re dealing with someone who is physically located in Iran, that is a sanctions-related risk.”The safest way to proceed for a company would be to reach out to OFAC and ask for specific guidance, “but you might not get a specific answer,” Tannebaum said.According to Amber Scott, founder and CEO of Canadian consulting firm Outlier Solutions, the risks for American companies providing services to countries under U.S. sanctions are quite real.“The U.S. has a stricter sanctions regime than other countries, as well as more severe consequences for violation,” Scott told CoinDesk. “It’s correct for institutions to take a cautious approach.”When it comes to technology, even giving people knowledge about circumventing the sanctions regime, which cryptocurrencies can do, can be considered a violation, Scott said. The case of Virgil Griffith definitely made the blockchain community in the U.S. stop and reconsider their approach to interaction with sanctioned jurisdictions, she added.Hope still lingersEarlier this year, ConsenSys Academy’s team seemed excited about educating Iranians, who often find themselves excluded from the global IT market. Last year, a group of seven Iranian women got a chance to study Solidity, a programming language for Ethereum smart contracts, for free thanks to ConsenSys Academy grants.The project was put together with the help of a local crypto association CoinIran. It was meant as “a diplomatic mission to give this opportunity to folks who need it,” as Coogan Brennan, then head of developer relations and now director of ConsenSys Academy, told CoinDesk in February.This year, the program was expanded so that 50 students from Iran were enrolled in September. Since then they all but finished the course and had been working on their final projects when the news came of their suspensions.Thessy Mehrain, a ConsenSys alumna and one of the creators of the program for Iranian students, said that Iran has a lot of tech talent, and people with coding skills should be able to contribute to development of Web 3 – a future decentralized internet – regardless of where they are geographically.“Those are the same people who can work on a world that works better for everyone, because we build technology that helps to collaborate, build reliable reputation and verify transactions,” Mehrain wrote to CoinDesk in a Twitter direct message.For Iranians, crypto provides a way to find jobs and earn money outside the country.“Because of sanctions, in Iran we can’t buy things, transfer money, participate in classes or have a bank account outside of Iran, and I think blockchain can help us to solve part of this injustice,” said Ahmadzadeh, the recent graduate.Read more: Here’s What We Know About Suex, the First Crypto Firm Sanctioned by USSome of the students are still hoping the situation can be resolved. As a temporary fix, students who live in other countries and did not choose Iran as their country during registration still can access the course, course participants interviewed by CoinDesk said. They are sharing the content with others so that people can finish their work, said one of the students, Navid Hosseini, who works as a developer at a crypto exchange he wouldn’t name.However, it won’t help students get official certificates from ConsenSys, which could provide “a springboard” for Iranian blockchain coders, Hosseini said.“I have known ConsenSys for many years for their products like MetaMask and Infura and I have known that they are one of the leading companies in the blockchain sector,” he said. “So, attending and passing this course was crucial for me and many other students that I know.”Reza Ghasemi, a cryptography professor at Bu-Ali Sina University in Iran, wanted to learn smart contracts coding so he could pass that knowledge on to his students, he said. That, in turn, would give them better career opportunities.In the end, Iranians are still enrolling in PhD programs abroad, he added, and he himself has been working on academic projects with colleagues in Canada and Turkey – although he doesn’t want to publicly name the academic institutions so as not to cause problems for them.He added he still hopes that the program’s mentors, which are the previous year’s students, can negotiate some solution with ConsenSys so that this year’s students finish their projects and get their certificates.Ghasemi said he believes the company gave in to pressure from overly cautious lawyers.“I believe that ConsenSys doesn’t like to do that, to ban us,” he said.","November 24, 2021, 8:04 AM"

The fund closed above its $30 million goal and has put money behind Bitwave, Lattice and BlockchainSpace.Asked to compare the Endeavor Fund to the NFT Fund, Maitra said Endeavor looks at early-stage investments across many sectors, including NFTs and gaming, but will predominantly invest in companies supporting NFT growth via equity and token investments.“The NFT fund focuses on investing in the actual NFTs themselves, many of which have immediate cash flows and yields and unique properties that accrue directly to the token holder,” Maitra told CoinDesk.Investment focuses for the Arca NFT Fund will include digital property, in-game assets, art and collectibles and how NFTs interact with decentralized finance (DeFi), to name a few.Arca’s NFT fund marks the latest venture capital bet on digital assets. In a research note published last month, Bank of America said VC investments in the sector surpassed $17 billion for the first half of 2021, up from $5.5 billion in the same period last year.","November 24, 2021, 8:50 AM"

With momentum around the metaverse growing daily, the tokens attached to the virtual world have soared in the last week.The biggest catalyst has been social media platform Facebook changing its name to Meta in late October, in a nod to the company's commitment and focus on building out its own metaverse - the next step in the evolution of online life.Sandbox, a Hong Kong-based gaming platform, has recently drawn in millions in funding, including from backers like SoftBank, as it gears up to launch its play-to-earn metaverse capabilities. The company said last week it would open up part of its metaverse from November 29.Its sand token has shot up by almost 100% in the last week, and was up 24% on Wednesday to trade around $6.81 by 07:30 a.m. ET. Sandbox visitors can monetize assets and gaming experience, including buying virtual plots of land, all with the sand token. Even German sports apparel maker Adidas said it is toying with the idea of building in the Sandbox metaverse.Big names have already jumped into the metaverse. Snoop Dogg announced in late September he would be buying a plot of land on Sandbox to build a mansion and will release his own non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which will give people VIP access to concerts and events on the platform.""We're seeing major movements in the metaverse currencies, as knowledge about 'play 2 earn' projects increase, and major institutional players hop on the train,"" Nicolai Qvale Fredriksen, analyst at Arcane Research said.Story continuesPlay-to-earn earn projects, where players earn digital coins as rewards, have become massive this year. Axie Infinity, an NFT-based online video game featuring cute cartoon axolotls, has seen its token triple in value in the last two months alone.Sandbox said on Twitter last  its Alpha hub would go live November 29 and would allow people to step into its metaverse for the first time and earn NFTs, as well as up to 1,000 sand tokens.""It will be very interesting to see how sand performs after the launch, and I will be surprised if the price drops below $6 again, given the already strong belief from the market,"" Fredriksen said.Decentraland, the virtual world where people can buy and sell digital real estate, has also drawn in some big backers.The Metaverse Group, a real estate company that is focused on the metaverse, announced on Tuesday that it had completed ""the largest metaverse land acquisition in history"" according to a statement. The company acquired 116 parcels of land ""in the heart of the Fashion Street district"" of Decentraland worth $2.5 million.Decentraland's mana token also got a boost from the surge in sand, and has gained almost 60% in the last week, and was last up 27% on the day at around $5.25 on Wednesday.""When it comes to mana, I believe the movement is due to a positive correlation with sand. If sand continues its boom, so will mana,"" Fredriksen said.Meanwhile, the more traditional cryptocurrencies, even so-called meme tokens like dogecoin and shiba inu, have been in a bit of a lull by comparison. Bitcoin has lost almost 7% in the last week and was last around $56,658, up around 0.6% since Tuesday.

Bitcoin is being heralded as an inflation hedge on a par with gold and ether is rapidly becoming the cryptocurrency of choice for decentralized finance, play-to-earn games, digital collectors' items, known as non-fungible tokens, and likely soon, the metaverse.But it's not either of these two cryptocurrencies that have captured the public's imagination.Dogecoin, which was founded by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmers in 2013 as a joke, has been the most searched-for cryptocurrency in the largest number of states so far this year, according to research by The Advisor Coach, a financial advisor. The coin, which is based on an internet meme of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog, was the most-googled in 23 states, including Florida, Illinois and Michigan.This year, it shot to prominence, thanks in large part to the Twitter-based cheerleading of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who is a known crypto enthusiast that holds dogecoin, bitcoin and ether. Musk even went so far as saying in May this year that he might accept dogecoin as payment for his company's electric vehicles.By that point, dogecoin was already beloved among the army of Reddit retail traders, who had pushed the coin up to around $0.07, from closer to $0.007 at the start of the year and Musk's payment remark sent the price to a record $0.70. It's since eased to around $0.24, but it's still one of the crypto stars of 2021, with a gain of nearly 5,000% so far.Story continues""The rise in interest can be partially attributed to the endorsement of Elon Musk who stated earlier in the year that Tesla would accept dogecoin as a form of payment,"" The Advisor Coach note said.Crypto traders' adoration of Musk extends well beyond what coins he holds and has given rise to dogecoin spinoffs.

The roadmap also covers settling and executing trades, loans backed by crypto assets, issuing stablecoins, tax services and whether to hold crypto assets on the balance sheet.The agencies also will assess applying bank capital and liquidity requirements for holding crypto assets, noting that they’ll continue to consult with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on capital requirements.The Basel Committee, part of the Bank of International Settlements, sets global standards for banking regulations. They’ve proposed two groups of capital requirements, including that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin should be subject to a higher risk weighting of 1250%.Yet large banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank oppose this capital level, calling it too conservative and could stop banks from being involved in the crypto market.The agencies stated they’ll continue to monitor developments in crypto-assets and may address other issues as the market evolves.Story continues“Regulators are promising actions that could probably impact decentralized finance and crypto trading,” says Jaret Seiberg, analyst with Cowen & Co. “It is broadly supportive of our view that regulators plan to treat crypto solutions the same as the product it is trying to replicate.”Officials are laying out their initiatives in the crypto space after the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets issued recommendations recently on how to regulate stablecoins, tasking regulators with using their current authorities to regulate the sector. That’s now being translated to all of crypto.OCC weighs inAs the regulators sketched out a broad outline of their plan to offer clarity on which crypto activities are legal for banks, the OCC, which oversees national banks, is clarifying that national banks and federal savings associations can engage in cryptocurrency activities — if they get approval from regulators. Few banks are engaging in crypto right now, but for those that aren’t, and want to do so going forward, will have to earn the agency's seal of approval.The OCC says banks must demonstrate to regulators that they have proper risk management controls in place before they can deal in crypto. The agency said on Tuesday that institutions need to address risks of cryptocurrencies, including hacking, fraud, and theft, liquidity risk, anti-money laundering, sanctions requirements, and consumer protection laws for the agency to determine whether they can deal in crypto safely. After receiving approval, only then can the bank engage in crypto activities.The OCC believes that providing cryptocurrency services is a modern form of traditional banking, and that banks are authorized to perform. Among permissible activities, the OCC has previously determined and is reiterating banks may hold deposits that serve as reserves for stablecoins that are backed on a 1:1 basis by a single fiat currency, and held in hosted wallets. Banks are also allowed to use distributed ledgers and stablecoins to help facilitate payments—that includes buying, selling, and issuing stablecoins to enable payments.“Providing this clarity will help ensure that these cryptocurrency, distributed ledger, and stablecoin activities will be conducted by national banks and federal savings associations in a safe and sound manner,” Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu said Tuesday. “This will provide assurance that crypto-asset activities taking place inside of the federal regulatory perimeter are being conducted responsibly.”As industry players stake out positions and try and influence the debate, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao said the cryptocurrency exchange wants to help regulators better understand the space, and offer proper protection to investors.“It’s always a subjective judgement,” Zhao told Yahoo Finance. “I think crypto definitely, compared to stock markets, is still much more nascent. I think the industry has grown to a point where there are many smaller players who are less protective of their users and we would like to see more regulations in the space so the retail consumers are protected.”Meanwhile, the vacancy for the vice chair of supervision on the Fed's Board of Governors could hold implications for crypto regulations. Senator Elizabeth Warren said the role “must be filled by a strong regulator with a proven track record of tough and effective enforcement - and it needs to be done quickly.” While regulators are putting their ideas out in a crypto sprint, President Joe Biden's pick for that position will get to influence the final outcome.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceRead the latest cryptocurrency and bitcoin news from Yahoo FinanceFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, Flipboard, and LinkedIn","November 24, 2021, 9:40 AM"

The fund closed above its $30 million goal and has put money behind Bitwave, Lattice and BlockchainSpace.Asked to compare the Endeavor Fund to the NFT Fund, Maitra said Endeavor looks at early-stage investments across many sectors, including NFTs and gaming, but will predominantly invest in companies supporting NFT growth via equity and token investments.“The NFT fund focuses on investing in the actual NFTs themselves, many of which have immediate cash flows and yields and unique properties that accrue directly to the token holder,” Maitra told CoinDesk.Investment focuses for the Arca NFT Fund will include digital property, in-game assets, art and collectibles and how NFTs interact with decentralized finance (DeFi), to name a few.Arca’s NFT fund marks the latest venture capital bet on digital assets.

260,260.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-being-squeezed-within-bearish-175323808.html,"Bitcoin Being Squeezed Within Bearish Flag, Break Lower to 53,000 Area on the Cards","Bitcoin (BTC/USD) has spent the last week consolidating within a bearish triangle formation. To the downside, support in the mid-55,000 area has been supporting the price action. To the upside, a downtrend linking the 10th and 12th of November lows and 16th, 18th, 20th, 21st and 22nd November highs have been capping the upside.Given BTC/USD’s continual printing of lower highs despite support in the 55,500 area holding firm, the price action has been getting squeezed. As is typically the case with bearish triangles, a bearish break in the short-term is the most likely scenario. Should such a break occur, bitcoin bears would likely target a move to the next area of key support just under 53,000, a high from early September.But if the bulls hold firmConversely, should the bulls stave off a break below the mid-55,000s and instead force a break above the recent downwards trendline, a move back towards the 50-day moving average around 60,500 would be on the cards. Just this month, the 50DMA has already proven a key level to watch, providing strong support to the price action back on the 17th of November, only to then offer solid resistance once prices had broken lower on the 20th and then 21st of November.Further complicating the quest of the bulls to return BTC to its recent record levels at 69,000 is the presence of the 21DMA in the mid-61,000s, slightly above the 50DMA. Above that, there is then more resistance in the form of 10th and 12th November lows in the 62,000s. A near-term break above all of these levels of resistance might prove challenging, with bitcoin instead opting to consolidate within the 55,500-60,000ish range it has carved out for itself in recent days.A dip to the September low a buying opportunity?It might reasonably be asked whether, in our more bearish scenario where the descending triangle breaks to the downside, ushering a push lower to support around 53,000, presents a buying opportunity for BTC. Indeed, since May, BTC has demonstrated the beginnings of a pattern where it consolidated within a range for a few months, then broke to the north of this range, then fell back to test the top of the old range, then pressed higher again. Who’s to say a drop back to the top of BTC’s August to early-October 41,000-53,000ish range won’t see the pattern repeat itself once more.Story continuesFurthermore, bitcoin’s 14-day Relative Strength Index current, which currently sits just above 40.00, would probably fall under 30.00 in the scenario where BTC drops all the way back to the 53,000 area. Whilst this hasn’t historically been the best short-term buy signal, it has successfully signalled that selling pressure may soon run out of steam and that trading conditions ahead are set to be more consolidative.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Silver Price Prediction – Prices Fall on Dollar StrengthSilver Price Forecast – Silver Markets StabilizingNatural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Testing 50 Day EMAFirst Trust Mid Cap Value AlphaDEX ETF is Still Strong Despite Recent DipWhy Gap Stock Is Down By 23% TodayS&P 500 Price Forecast – Stock Markets Quiet Heading Into Thanksgiving","November 24, 2021, 9:53 AM"

Bitcoin, for its part, dropped 14% on WazirX and just 0.5% on Binance, the article said. Tether, a stablecoin, also sunk on the exchange while remaining steady elsewhere, Coindesk reported.A proposed law in India is seeking to ban all private cryptocurrencies, likely causing the price declines on the local exchanges.The price drops opened up an opportunity for investors to buy the dip and profit elsewhere. According to CoinDesk's report, arbitrage opportunities in India are mainly helpful for small-time investors because bigger market makers avoid the country for lack of regulatory clarity.But the trick was figuring out how to transfer funds to a different exchange after purchasing the assets at a lower cost, Bloomberg said. And it's not easy. WazirX tweeted out that it was experiencing trading delays in the app, and frustrated users responded that they could not move their crypto.

270,270.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/el-salvador-needs-imf-bitcoin-185039310.html,El Salvador: Who Needs the IMF When You Have Bitcoin?,"Christopher Nolan’s third Batman film, “The Dark Knight Rises,” is generally considered the weakest entry in the series, in part because it’s so easily read as a celebration of neoliberal authoritarianism. The film’s plot has the villain, Bane, take over Gotham City, wipe out all financial ledgers and reign over a kind of mega-Occupy movement. To fight back, Batman engages in a series of moral compromises that he justifies as, more or less, necessary exceptions to defend a more broadly just system.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.The International Monetary Fund has been playing the Batman role in the global order for decades. Though nominally aimed at supporting democracy and free markets, reforms mandated by the IMF in exchange for its loans have historically included serious cuts to social spending and industrial policy. The fallout is often devastating: The IMF’s (real world) body count is considerably higher than Batman’s.El Salvador, a country with low income and high debt, has been in negotiations with the IMF for one of its loans in the amount of $1.3 billion. One roadblock has been the country’s recent adoption of bitcoin as legal tender. The IMF signaled it wasn’t too happy with that idea.On Monday, El Salvador introduced a $1 billion “Bitcoin Bond” that could present at least a partial end-run around the IMF, highlighting why bitcoin made the IMF so queasy in the first place. “The Dark Knight Rises” contains a notorious moment, drawn from the Batman comics, in which Bane pummels Batman so badly that his back is broken, leaving him paralyzed and vulnerable. That’s about how the IMF is going to feel if El Salvador finds a way to raise large sums of international financing, as a developing country with a troubled economy, without the IMF or corruption-riddled global banks.Story continuesThe bond allows purchases in units of $100, using bitcoin or tether. It will be issued by Bitfinex, an essentially stateless and unregulated platform. So there are probably few if any controls on who can buy into this bond, either by source or by amount.That means one simple thing: El Salvador will absolutely sell out of this bond, and will probably be able to issue another round. It will replace that $1.3 billion from the IMF without breaking a sweat, even taking into account that about half of the first bond sale will go into a bitcoin fund.There doesn’t need to be any further explanation of this than “Bitcoiners are nuts and rich,” and would gladly pump money into this small country for the lulz. More seriously, every one of these experiments that pans out is another win for bitcoin, so pitching in is also a matter of enlightened self-interest. Remember that an Ethereum DAO just raised $40 million for what was essentially a vaguely civic-minded prank – $1 billion for an actual bond with an actual return is nothing.Let’s leave aside the touted “Bitcoin City” El Salvador says it wants to build using the other half of the first bond. That’s mostly a marketing stunt: For $500 million, at best the country will get a couple of power plants, a server farm and an IHOP. And that’s actually fine! Assuming El Salvador follows through in broad strokes, you do need some kind of infrastructure to support the mining facilities, so whether or not it’s a “city” right off the bat is a matter of semantics. And $500 million of new capital in the small country will have a major impact regardless of how it’s spent.Read more: The ‘Bitcoin City’ Fantasy – Dan Kuhn So, kudos to El Salvador for burning down Wall Street and building a throne out of the skulls of predatory bankers. That said, the bond might not be a terribly great investment.For one thing, it introduces political counterparty risk to your bitcoin strategy. This is a country that only emerged from near-anarchy in 1994, and while President Nayib Bukele seems to have sturdy popularity, a disruptive change in leadership or the political order could mean creditors don’t get paid back. That’s not necessarily likely, but it’s on the table in a way that it’s not with, say, U.S. Treasury bonds (or just buying bitcoin yourself).Also, Blockstream’s projection that the bond will return 165% annually over 10 years is based on the bet that bitcoin will be trading at $1 million by that time. I consider that completely possible, but also completely unknowable. A 10-year projection for literally any asset is pretty much always going to be a made-up number. Invest accordingly – unless your real priority is to change the world.","November 24, 2021, 10:50 AM"

""Invest here and earn all the money you want,"" he told the euphoric crowd.Supporters have hailed Bukele's plans - including making bitcoin legal tender in September - saying they would bring jobs, financial inclusion and foreign investment to one of the Western Hemisphere's poorest countries.""Feel the Bit"" read the giant screen before Bukele - who brands himself ""CEO of El Salvador"" on Twitter - came on stage.But some in El Salvador and beyond expressed outrage at the glitzy event in a nation beleaguered by inequality, violence and poor public services.""This video makes me sick, angry and sad at the same time,"" said Marce, twitter user @_lamismadeayer.The government says the issuance of $1 billion in ""Volcano bonds"" in partnership with Blockstream - a digital assets infrastructure company - would provide development funds. El Salvador currently faces a $500 million budget gap for next year according to credit rating agency Fitch.But the bitcoin bond is not designed to cover that gap.Half of the bond money would go to infrastructure, including for building Bitcoin City, with the remainder used to purchase bitcoin and locked up for five years. After the lock up, the bitcoin can be sold, generating a capital return that will be split 50-50 between the government and investors, only after the initial $500 million are recouped, according to the plan.Story continuesThe 10-year bitcoin bond offers a 6.5% coupon, payable yearly, but another Salvadoran bond that matures in 2032 is currently yielding close to 13.9%.Financial markets have reacted warily. The spread of Salvadoran yields to safe-haven U.S. Treasuries has widened sharply since late April. This week it added an extra 79 basis points and sits above 1,200 bps, its widest ever.Investors sold off El Salvador's bonds in May after the Bukele-controlled Congress fired the attorney general and five Supreme Court judges, who were replaced with loyalists, critics say.The 2025 bond yields more than 18%, according to Refinitiv data. With such a high cost, the country is effectively excluded from borrowing on the market.Graham Stock, senior sovereign analyst at Blue Bat Asset Management, said government funding through bitcoin could discourage El Salvador from adopting sustainable spending policies, adding the country would likely continue to need International Monetary Fund support.""Building the economy around crypto mining and attracting crypto businesses is an untested strategy to put it mildly,"" he said, adding Bukele did not appear to have plans to increase growth and tax revenues. IMF TALKS STALLEDTalks with the IMF for a $1 billion loan have stalled amid concerns over a lack of transparency and the price volatility of cryptocurrency, as well as fears of democratic backsliding as Bukele consolidates power. But many in the cryptocurrency community are upbeat, saying the bond will harness strong retail demand.""Bitcoin bonds are a game-changer in fixed income markets,” said Moritz Wietersheim, founder of Specter Solutions, a bitcoin security and product company.Although bitcoin has fallen about 16% from its record high of $68,990.90 this month, it remains up over 90% this year.""Bitcoin Week"" marked the first time the digital currency experiment was stress-tested by international crypto evangelists.As vendors hawked ""Jesus Loves Bitcoin"" shirts, panel discussions grouped crypto currency leaders and Salvadoran ministers. Excitement was widespread at having a 'petri dish', as many attendees called El Salvador’s experiment.Several attendees aired worries about the government's Chivo wallet, where Salvadorans can send and receive bitcoin - highlighting tensions over a state tool for a currency created as an alternative to government financial systems.Pre-loaded with $30 for users and backed by a $150 million fund, Chivo allows users to make transactions to other Chivo users fee-free, but registration requires Salvadorans to enter their ID numbers and other personal information while transactions are kept on a ledger.Some attendees described Chivo as a gateway to independent bitcoin wallets, such as Muun or BlueWallet, that offer privacy.""When I make a payment, in the notes section, I write ‘use Muun, don’t use Chivo,’"" said Wietersheim, using the hashtag #FixChivo on Twitter.Since its rollout, Chivo has been criticized for thousands of cases of fraud and money disappearing from wallets.Several programmers said that for the speed of implementation - less than four months after Bukele announced it at a June conference - these technical problems were normal.Bukele has blamed high demand for the issues. A spokesperson for the president's office and Chivo could not be reached for comment.(Additional reporting by Rodrigo Campos in New York; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Aurora Ellis)","November 24, 2021, 11:18 PM"

That, and other increasingly ambitious plans to put bitcoin at the center of its economy, are wagers that America’s global influence is waning.“I know the concerns here in D.C. are about losing the power of the dollar and we can understand that, but El Salvador has to move on [because] it wants to be on a different level,” Mayorga said. El Salvador adopted the U.S. dollar as legal tender in 2001 after the failure of its native currency, the colón.Concerns about El Salvador’s monetary experiment are widespread. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged El Salvador to strengthen the regulation and supervision of bitcoin use in the country, noting the “significant risks” that come with the cryptocurrency.El Salvador will be closely watched in 2022. Besides its recently announced “Bitcoin City,” a low-tax, legal municipality pitched as a mecca for wealthy bitcoin investors, the Central American country plans to raise $1 billion via a bitcoin bond, a tokenized financial instrument in partnership with Bitcoin infrastructure company Blockstream.Although no other country has yet to follow El Salvador in putting bitcoin on equal footing as the U.S. dollar, many are beginning to think seriously about digital currencies. Neighboring Honduras and Guatemala, for instance, are both studying central bank digital currencies.Read more: Paraguay Proposed Bitcoin Law Includes Crypto Registration: ReportSo far, the Biden administration has been mum about what’s happening south of the U.S. border. “We have to have the conversation, but we are an independent country, so [the U.S. has] to accept our movement and understand that we want to take ourselves to a different level and with a definitional system,” Mayorga said.","November 24, 2021, 11:23 AM"

As a result, we will be limiting the ability for U.S. users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX,” said an eToro spokesperson.Starting December 26, users won’t be able to open new positions in either coin, and their ability to receive a yield for staking those same assets will end on December 31.While eToro assured customers they will not be forced to sell their existing holdings in those cryptocurrencies, both assets came under selling pressure since the announcement. eToro did not specify exactly what concerns prompted the move.   Mati Greenspan, CEO of investment research firm Quantum Economics, told Yahoo Finance that he couldn’t immediately identify which U.S. regulations affect ADA and TRX that don’t also apply to the rest of the crypto market.“As a user and former employee I support their decision but a bit more clarity into their train of thought would be appreciated by the community,” said Greenspan.'Unclear' motivesCardano tumbled after a crypto platform moved to limit trading in the digital coin.The wide reaching effort to rein in what Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has called the ""Wild West"" of digital currencies has stirred uncertainty in the crypto sector. It's led to some market players scrambling to influence the debate over regulation — and others to try and get out ahead of possible enforcement actions, which could be driving eToro's thinking.The SEC classifies Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) - the two largest cryptocurrencies - as commodities instead of securities, but most cryptocurrencies sold on exchanges to U.S. investors aren’t registered as such.Story continuesExpressing his personal views numerous times since taking office as the SEC’s head, Gensler has said that many crypto assets — especially those that fall in the Decentralized Finance or DeFi space — are 'Decentralized In Name Only (DINO)’. That means the SEC could very well begin to take enforcement action on crypto exchanges that offer these assets.In December 2020, the SEC announced that it would sue another top cryptocurrency, Ripple (XRP). While the lawsuit is ongoing, roughly 80 different cryptocurrency exchanges at least briefly de-listed XRP according to Carol Goforth, a Law Professor at the University of Arkansas who specializes in securities and crypto regulation.“That is where I have seen most of the de-listing that has occurred, but it's not clear yet that’s what is going on here,” Goforth told Yahoo Finance.Like stablecoins, crypto lending or offering customers the chance to earn “staking rewards” has drawn scrutiny from regulators. In September, the SEC cut short Coinbase’s efforts to launch their own lending service, with Gensler insisting that the product offering needed to be registered as a security. Meanwhile, crypto lenders BlockFi — reportedly under investigation by the SEC — and Celsius Network have faced numerous cease and desist orders from state securities regulators.There are a number of reasons why an exchange might want to “de-list” a cryptocurrency for U.S. consumers according to Goforth. But she could not determine any unique characteristic of ADA or TRX which would make them a target for regulators. Underscoring the opaqueness of eToro's decision, Bitstamp — a far larger exchange — just recently listed Cardano for trading, which made the move to limit trading ""particularly confusing, unless eToro knows something that we don’t,” said Goforth. Conversely, “Tron has a relatively high trading volume, but again, I don’t see anything that makes it particularly likely to be a target for regulators.”Goforth suggested eToro might have also be using an “internal reviewing” process that points to these assets being riskier, or more likely to be the targets of regulatory attention.David Hollerith covers cryptocurrency for Yahoo Finance.

BTC has failed above $60K a few times and it will take some doing to break through that level,” Pankaj Balani, CEO of Delta Exchange, a crypto derivatives trading platform, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.“We should expect downward pressure and higher volatility on all risky assets including BTC, but $1 trillion market capitalization level (currently around $53K BTC) should hold as a good support for bitcoin in the short term,” Balani wrote.Prepare for higher volatilitySome analysts expect an increase in bitcoin and ether options volatility, which means sharp price movements could occur over the next few days.Bitcoin’s daily implied volatility has declined since May and could be set for a near-term rise from relatively low levels. “Unlike traditional equities markets, where price volatility generally occurs to the downside, bitcoin can express significant price volatility in both directions due to leveraged perpetual futures trading,” crypto asset manager Two Prime wrote in a report earlier this week.Story continuesAdditionally, “with bitcoin leverage ratios still relatively high, further price declines could set off a cascade of liquidations which could see bitcoin rapidly test its 100-day moving average (currently around $53K BTC),” Two Prime wrote.Bitcoin implied and realized volatility (Skew)Similar to bitcoin, ether’s volatility has also trended lower, albeit with greater swings. This is likely due to more speculative interest in the options market for ETH relative to BTC.As shown in the chart above, “when implied volatility (options market expectations of future volatility) is substantially higher than realized volatility (the actual price fluctuation during past trading ranges), an increase in the latter is usually around the corner and long volatility options positions pay exponential returns,” Two Prime wrote.Altcoin roundupSHIB slumps as large holders take profits: Shiba inu, the self-proclaimed “dogecoin killer,” may still have its passionate following but it was in the red again Wednesday following three consecutive weeks of losses.

That said, bitcoin is showing no signs of slowing down with mainstream adoption likely to gain further momentum in the year ahead.”Last month, Ethereum overtook the value of JPMorgan Chase for the first time and is currently the world’s 15th most valuable asset with a market cap of more than half a trillion dollars – $10bn more than JPMorgan’s.Story continuesData from global assets aggregator CompaniesMarketCap shows that Ethereum is also ahead of payments giants Matercard, PayPal and Visa.Read MoreEthereum price smashes record high amid metaverse and NFT buzzWhat’s going on with ethereum?

This latest development comes due to regulatory concerns regarding the cryptocurrencies.In its blog post yesterday, eToro said, “US users will not be able to open new ADA or TRX positions starting on December 26, 2021. Additionally, staking for those assets will end on December 31, 2021. These changes are due to business-related considerations in the evolving regulatory environment.”The brokerage platform assured its US users that they could hold existing ADA and TRX positions and close them at any time.

With 5.44 trillion MEX set to be distributed over the course of a year, the value of the program currently sits at $7.32 billion worth of incentives – likely the largest liquidity mining program in DeFi history, assuming prices remain stable.Additionally, in an interview with CoinDesk, Elrond Network CEO Beniamin Mincu said that an initial airdrop of MEX tokens to Elrond EGLD token stakers helped to bootstrap usage.“With 60,000 users who could claim MEX based on their EGLD holdings before go-live, the Maiar DEX had an impressive Day 1 user count, which keeps increasing,” he said.Ethereum scaling network Arbitrum is ahead of Elrond in TVL at $2.35 billion, and Waves is 11th with $1.5 billion. The Ethereum mainnet leads all chains with a commanding $171.9 billion – well over half of DeFi’s aggregate $260 billion in value managed by various protocols.As the competition heats up between layer 1s to attract users and funds, projects are increasingly turning to massive incentive programs to stand out. Harmony, Fantom, Avalanche and Oasis are a few of the leaders who have turned to the tactic or are planning to, but so far not at Maiar and Elrond’s scale.Mincu said that Elrond currently has functioning cross-chain bridges to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom and Tron, and that more DeFi verticals will be coming to Elrond in the coming months, including lending and synthetic assets.","November 24, 2021, 2:06 PM"

Ether dropped below $4,300, a more than 2% decline.(CoinDesk/CryptoCompare)Meanwhile, a recovery in the price for the USDT/CNY (tether/Chinese yuan) pair indicated the market in China is slowly recovering from the country’s September severe ban on crypto trading, according to the Hong Kong-based crypto financial service provider Babel Finance.Babel Finance wrote in its weekly newsletter dated Nov. 22 that tether’s quoted prices in the yuan on the over-the-counter (OTC) market have recovered in the past week.Under normal market conditions, the price of tether expressed in yuan should match that of the U.S. dollar’s exchange rate with the Asian currency, but tether has traded at a significant discount since China’s ban.A recovery from this discount indicates that China’s crypto market has returned to normal from the ban, which could be good news for the markets due to China’s historical significance in crypto.Technician’s takeBitcoin Held Support at $53K, Faces Initial Resistance Around $60KBitcoin daily price chart (Damanick Dantes/CoinDesk, TradingView)Bitcoin (BTC) is holding support above its 100-day moving average, which is currently at $53,700.

The pricing decline for Cardano's ADA token appears partly driven by overall market momentum, but it's also likely that token-specific news is factoring into the pullback.","November 24, 2021, 1:46 PM"
298,298.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ada-rocked-etoro-announces-surprise-135023349.html,ADA Rocked After eToro Announces Surprise Delisting in US,"The crypto community was left shocked on Tuesday following a surprise move by popular retail trading platform eToro to delist Cardano’s cryptocurrency ADA in the US by the end of 2021.eToro, an Israeli social trading and multi-asset brokerage company that offers copy trading services covering forex and crypto, said regulatory concerns motivated the decision. The company also announced that it would be delisting Tron’s TRX.“The regulatory landscape for crypto is evolving rapidly… As a result, we will be limiting the ability for US users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX” a spokesperson from eToro told Business Insider.The surprise delisting triggered selling in ADA. The cryptocurrency now trades more than 5% down on the week, with its market cap having tumbled from above $61B at the start of the week to under $58B as of Thursday.As of the 26th of December 2021, eToro US users will no longer be able to buy the cryptocurrency. Then, after the 31st of December 2021, users holding ADA will no longer be able to earn staking rewards.In a video response to the decision, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, blamed the decision on a lack of regulatory clarity and played down the impact the delisting would have on ADA’s price in the long term.He explained that European-based exchanges like eToro tend to limit their US exposure, given that US exposure comes with high regulatory costs. US-based exchanges like Coinbase, which are already paying for US regulatory compliance, have an easier in the US, he added.About Cardano and its Cryptocurrency ADACardano is an open-source, decentralised blockchain platform that achieves consensus using proof-of-stake and can facilitate internal transactions using its cryptocurrency ADA.It was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, and was initially funded through an initial coin offering (ICO). In 2017, Cardano launched its crypto-currency ADA.Story continuesADA is the largest cryptocurrency (by market capitalisation) to use a proof-of-stake blockchain. Proponents of proof-of-stake blockchains argue that it is significantly more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.Back in February, Hoskinson estimated that the Cardano network used just 0.01% of the energy used by the Bitcoin network.ADA Back Sharply from September’s Record HighsADA surpassed $3.0 in September, taking its gains on the year at the time to more than 1700%. Since the all-time highs printed two months ago, however, the cryptocurrency has seen a sharp correction.As of Thursday, with ADA trading in the mid-$1.700s, the cryptocurrency is down more than 40% from its prior record highs. But the cryptocurrency still trades with on-the-year gains of more than 800%.As regulatory concerns build and the broader crypto market continues to struggle, further profit-taking may see ADA drop back towards the next key area of support in the $1.0 area, which would amount to a further 40% correction.But between April and July this year, the $1.0 area proved to be a profitable area for short-term buyers on four different occasions. There is every chance this buy-the-dip mentality could return.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Trying to RecoverWTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+USD/JPY Price Forecast – US Dollar Continues to Press Ever so HigherTesla Shares Rally Despite Musk Selling Over $1 Billion of His StakeAUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis – Taking Out .7170 Could Trigger Acceleration into .7106Natural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Quiet During Holiday Trading","November 25, 2021, 5:50 AM"

Ether, on the other hand, on Wednesday managed to bounce off of its own such trendline.The second-largest token sees good round-number technical support at $4,000, according to Mike McGlone, a commodities analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “It seems to be a battle with the leveraged longs from higher levels getting flushed and the longer-term, more institutional bid below the market,” he said. McGlone sees Ether consolidating its bull run within the $4,000 to $5,000 range.Cryptocurrencies have sold off in recent days amid a number of concerns, including greater regulatory risks as well as many tokens having run up very quickly in a short period of time. The Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, which measures the performance of a handful of the largest tokens, has lost 14% so far this month.News that India is preparing a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies appears to be behind the latest leg of the selloff in Bitcoin on Wednesday on exchanges popular with Indian investors. Bitcoin was down almost 14% at one point on WazirX while little changed elsewhere.Some analysts are also citing waning risk appetite in the broader equities market, where profitless technology companies have suffered the brunt of the declines.“We see Bitcoin come off in valuation when we see a selloff in the more speculative parts of the equity market,” Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said by phone.Story continuesOn Wednesday, Bitcoin lost as much as 3.1% to trade at $55,908, while Ether fell 4.2% at one point to $4,168.The important thing is that both Ether and Bitcoin held their lows from last week, according to Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “Those lows -- $55,500 on XBT and $4,000 on XET -- are the more important short-term support levels.”Although Bitcoin has seen a sharp pullback within its intermediate-term uptrend, it is showing signs of short-term downside exhaustion per a number of indicators, according to Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, an independent research firm focused on technical analysis. Plus, its oversold conditions increase the probability that it’s put a low into place.“We expect Bitcoin to resume its intermediate-term uptrend, allowing it to ultimately break out above resistance near $65K for a long-term measured move projection of $90K,” she wrote in a note.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t HelpingWildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the BenefitsHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in AmericaBoeing Built an Unsafe Plane, and Blamed the Pilots When It Crashed©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","November 24, 2021, 9:10 AM"

So-called whale transaction counts, or the number of SHIB transactions valued more than $100,000, have been rising since the beginning of November. Active deposits, or the amount of daily unique addresses to deposit SHIB to centralized exchanges, have also been increasing.Large valued SHIB transactions vs. SHIB's price. (Santiment)A spike in the active deposit metric may indicate a rise in short-term sell pressure for the token, according to Santiment’s metric explainer.“Like any asset, SHIB price is the product of supply and demand ... a larger percentage of SHIB buyers were evidently attracted by its speculative appeal alone,” Rick Delaney, a senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. “Drawn by the asset’s rising price, many SHIB investors simply do not have the long-term conviction needed to hold their positions or to reenter the market while the price is dropping.”Falling trading volumeWhile SHIB was once the most traded token on centralized exchanges, its trading volume has dropped significantly, as CoinGecko’s data shows.Story continuesNansen said that trading volume is among the most important metrics for SHIB and other meme tokens because a drop in trading volume shows that investors start to lose interest and become more “cautious” of putting money in the meme-themed tokens.The most traded alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on centralized exchanges now are gaming-related tokens, including decentraland (MANA) and the sandbox (SAND), according to CoinGecko.“SHIB’s price fall can be mostly attributed to the recent shift in investors’ interest from meme tokens to metaverse projects,” crypto price-tracking site CoinMarketCap wrote in a response to CoinDesk. “That can easily be seen by comparing the trading volume of MANA, SAND and SHIB.“Trading volume is always related to investors’ interest in a project,” it added.Social media buzz around the canine-themed coin has also sunk dramatically. At the time of publication, Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge retail interest in trending topics, showed a value of 22 for the search query “SHIB” globally, down from a peak at 100 at the end of October.A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time. A value of 22 means fewer people are scanning the web for information on SHIB.Silver liningDespite declining social media buzz around the meme token, retail investors’ interest in SHIB remains strong as the number of unique addresses holding SHIB continues to increase – good news for the SHIBArmy.The number of unique addresses holding SHIB surpassed one million on Nov. 11 – a time when SHIB’s prices were already dropping, according to Nansen data.“Retail interest is definitely there still, as people take speculative bets,” Daniel Khoo, research analyst at Nansen, said. “[No one] wants to miss out on getting rich.”","November 24, 2021, 11:19 AM"
302,302.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-fights-survival-parabolic-bull-073733183.html,Bitcoin Fights for Survival In A Parabolic Bull Market,"Bitcoin was trading in a tight range of around $57k on Thursday morning despite major crypto assets being lower. Based on technical indicators, Bitcoin’s downside is capped at $53k, which suggests buyers will remain active towards $60K resistance.As part of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, strong dollar amid reports of an Indian Crypto ban trading volumes continue to decline. Although some analysts expect volatility to increase as November draws to a close in the bitcoin and ether options marketsPrices could move sharply over the next few days due to rising volatility, which could discourage buyers from holding onto positions for an extended period of time.Whales deposit Bitcoins at exchanges. Curiously, the exchanges have continued to outflow money, which has resulted in the reserves remaining near their lowest levels since mid-2018.In a report somewhat contradictory, Glassnode said long-term holders may not be spending as much as they were and are therefore more likely to be adding to positions than exiting them.There are two confluences on the chart from a technical perspective: the first is the 38% Fibonacci retracement level, and the second is the trendline that dates back to March 2020 and serves as support.Once the level is successfully backtested as support, it is possible that the uptrend will resume. On the other hand, the 50-day MA (*$60.6K), as well as $60K, seem to be the main immediate resistance levels.Bears might still have some runway left due to the constant trading volume during this correction. This calls for caution.As the RSI is making higher lows on the 4-hour chart, there are signs of bullish divergence, even though the RSI is falling on the daily time frame (but hasn’t reached oversold conditions yet). In order to confirm it, Bitcoin must hold above $53K and rise meaningfully.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Shiba Inu Keeps Moving Lower As Whale Transactions Fail To Provide Enough SupportEthereum Price Prediction – Bulls Take Control with an Eye on $4,500AS Monaco, A French Football Club, Adopts CryptoEuropean Equities: FOMC Meeting Minutes to Set the Tone ahead of Key Stats from GermanyGold And Silver Face Strong Pressure As Short-Term Yields RiseStripe is Open to Accepting Crypto Payments Again","November 24, 2021, 11:37 PM"

The fund closed above its $30 million goal and has put money behind Bitwave, Lattice and BlockchainSpace.Asked to compare the Endeavor Fund to the NFT Fund, Maitra said Endeavor looks at early-stage investments across many sectors, including NFTs and gaming, but will predominantly invest in companies supporting NFT growth via equity and token investments.“The NFT fund focuses on investing in the actual NFTs themselves, many of which have immediate cash flows and yields and unique properties that accrue directly to the token holder,” Maitra told CoinDesk.Investment focuses for the Arca NFT Fund will include digital property, in-game assets, art and collectibles and how NFTs interact with decentralized finance (DeFi), to name a few.Arca’s NFT fund marks the latest venture capital bet on digital assets. In a research note published last month, Bank of America said VC investments in the sector surpassed $17 billion for the first half of 2021, up from $5.5 billion in the same period last year.","November 24, 2021, 8:50 AM"

315,315.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bearish-sentiment-grips-bitcoin-ahead-103725930.html,Bearish Sentiment Grips Bitcoin Ahead of $3B Options Expiry,"Bitcoin put options, derivatives offering downside protection, continue to become pricier, implying bearish sentiment. The price volatility may rise as major exchanges, including Deribit, are due to settle monthly options on Friday.The three-month put-call skew, which measures the cost of puts relative to calls, has turned positive, hit a 6-week high of 3%, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.The positive number shows that put options are drawing higher prices or demand than calls or bullish bets. At the start of the month, the three-month gauge stood at -5%, indicating a bullish bias.The one-week and one-month put-call skews have seen similar ascents this month and are signaling bearish bias with above-zero prints. The six-month put-call skew has turned neutral.A positive skew does not necessarily mean traders are taking outright bearish bets rather they could be adding downside protection against long positions in the spot or futures markets.In any case, it indicates fear in the market, which is warranted, given bitcoin’s 16% fall after hitting a record high of $68,990 on Nov. 10.Concerns that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) may chalk out a faster end to its two-year stimulus program and the resulting strength in the dollar appear to have driven the cryptocurrency lower. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback’s value against major fiat currencies, has increased by 3% since the hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation data released on Nov. 10.The Fed began cutting back on the monthly bond-buying program from this month and stands ready to accelerate the unwinding of stimulus if things continue to heat up. Minutes from the November Fed meeting released on Wednesday shows that policymakers were willing to raise interest rates if inflation continues to rise.So, the dollar may remain strong in the coming weeks, keeping bitcoin gains under check.Options expiryData provided by Skew shows a total of 51,900 options contracts worth nearly $3 billion are due for expiry on Friday. About $2.5 billion worth of options will be settled by Deribit, the world’s largest crypto options exchange, at 08:00 am UTC.Story continuesThe majority of open interest is concentrated in call options at strikes above bitcoin’s record price. The max pain, or the price level at which option buyers would suffer the most loss on expiry, is $58,000.According to a theory, the max pain acts as a magnet while heading into the expiry as option sellers, typically large institutions, buy or sell the underlying asset to keep the price around key levels to inflict maximum loss on buyers.While there is no evidence of sellers using such strategies in the bitcoin market, the cryptocurrency has, in the past, moved in the direction of the max pain point ahead of expiry and gained strong directional bias after the settlement.So, the prospects of a big move in the next day or two cannot be ruled out, more so, as volumes are likely to be thin due to the Thanksgiving holiday.Bitcoin was last seen trading near $58,200, representing a 1.8% gain on the day.","November 25, 2021, 2:37 AM"

Another plot of digital land sold this week for more than $2 million in a virtual world, highlighting how much investors are willing to pay out to secure space before the metaverse really goes mainstream.This time, it was a Genesis land plot on Axie Infinity. The play-to-earn platform said in a tweet on Wednesday that a piece of land had sold for 550 ether, worth over $2.3 million at current levels. Axie Infinity allows users to create digital pet axolotls to play games, buy land and other asets and win and sell axie-related non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It even has its own cryptocurrency - AXS - which is one of the most traded among metaverse-linked tokens.""We believe this is the largest sum ever paid for a single plot of digital land,"" Axie tweeted.Prior to this latest sale, the project's biggest sale was worth 888.25 ether for nine plots of land, which amounted to over $1.5 million at the time it was sold in February.Axie Infinity, which was created by Sky Mavis, a Vietnam-based company, is one of the biggest non-fungible token platforms in the world.NFTs are unique digital tokens that are a big part of the growing metaverse platform. Mark Zuckerberg's Meta - formerly Facebook - will be focusing on creating this virtual reality, as will Gemini exchange founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who recently raised funds to build out their own metaverse.Another property sold for $2.43 million on rival platform Decentraland on Tuesday. Both these price tags are higher than those for most real-life homes in some of the US's most expensive cities.The growing momentum in the metaverse has also fueled steep rises in the value of the cryptocurrencies that are linked to the virtual world.

318,318.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrency-currency-future-142000578.html,Is cryptocurrency the currency of the future?,"For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberationIn this news cycle, cryptocurrency seems to be the only thing anyone is talking about. It seems society has suddenly propelled back to the future as we have seen nations start to adopt a phenomenon known to many as crypto — the world’s newest medium of exchange.The best way to describe crypto is as the digital currency it is, thinking of the many different types of cryptocurrency as currencies with different utilities. The one quality that they all share is that they contribute to the creation of a richer digital experience.The Bitcoin logo appears on the display screen of a cryptocurrency ATM at the Smoker’s Choice store in Salem, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)The challenging part is understanding that cryptocurrency fluctuates rapidly and can be volatile — sparking the interest of investors and micro-investors throughout the world who are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. Some experts believe cryptocurrency is all about timing and crypto-believers argue that cash and the USD is archaic and truly the inferior form of currency … but are these investors right?It is impossible to demystify the secret of cryptocurrency without answering the infamous question — what is blockchain? Often discussed in tandem, many mix up the idea of cryptocurrency with blockchain, and others simply don’t know the difference.Blockchain is a decentralized technology that is incredibly secure (think of the root of the word crypto — as in encryption). The benefit of blockchains is that its technology is spread across many different computer operating systems, thus arguably making them more secure than existing payment systems.Easily accessible crypto-wallets like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Gemini, have made it easy to buy and sell over 50 different cryptocurrencies. Gemini is particularly interesting because of its founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who started the company in 2014.If you ever watched The Social Network, you will remember the Winklevoss Twins — the two brothers that infamously founded HarvardConnection, a social media network on Harvard’s campus that predated Facebook. Although the Winklevoss brothers seemed to have lost the Facebook war, they continue to prove themselves as formidable opponents to Mark Zuckerberg in the “Metaverse”— going on to found one of cryptocurrency’s leading exchanges.Story continuesHowever, while the Winklevoss brothers have used this and their other investments to propel them into the billionaire stratosphere along with their rival Zuckerberg — cryptocurrency has always had a different meaning for Black and Brown people.For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberation. In this case, it comes as no surprise that Black people have been, by and large, leading the cryptocurrency boom. The University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center reports that 46% of cryptocurrency holders are people of color — with 18% of those holders being Black. These numbers make sense considering the deep seated distrust in the Black community surrounding government regulation and the wealth gap.The Bitcoin logo is displayed on the side of a Bitcoin ATM on November 10, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)To many, cryptocurrency will serve as the great equalizer that education was once viewed as in this country. Accessibility is another reason for cryptocurrency’s success within the Black community. Investors can purchase cryptocurrency at a painfully low entry point — you only need a dollar to buy crypto as you can fractionally invest in currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum buying a minute fraction of the coin.This enables folks with less disposable income to get in on the fun whereas the stock market has traditionally excluded these population groups. But cryptocurrency has implications that span far larger than just Black America. Cryptocurrency has also become a force to be reckoned with on the forefront of the global community. This has left many economists asking the question of what crypto means for the global economy?Akon was perhaps one of the first celebrities to openly discuss cryptocurrency and its ramifications, as early as 2018, when he declared his own cryptocurrency, Akoin. Akon noted that this cryptocurrency would guide Africa into financial freedom and be the basis upon which his futuristic city would be built.If Akon’s plan does succeed, it would liberate the Senegalese people from the French-backed CFA (the national currency of Senegal and many Francophone countries in West Africa). But Senegal isn’t the only African country interested in cryptocurrency. Nigeria has quickly grown to be the second largest market for crypto trading, following the United States.Akon attends the Jingle Bell Ball at the O2 Arena on December 5, 2010 in London, England. (Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)Many Nigerians have found the use of cryptocurrency as a solvent way to protect their money against the depreciation of the Naira (which is linked to the USD.) Moreover, cryptocurrency simplifies the transference of remittances (money sent back home by nationals or family members who live internationally) and minimizes costs and fees. The issue of remittances is a phenomenon that can be seen throughout the African continent and across the pond in the Caribbean and Latin America as well.El Salvador has led the Latin American community in cryptocurrency, becoming the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. Both President Nayib Bukele and Maria Luisa Hayem, El Salvador’s Minister of Economy, are proud to have led Latin America into this innovative economic revolution. Despite their efforts, adoption has been slow, with only 12% of consumers using cryptocurrency since the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in September.Yet not all countries have bought into the hype, with China banning all crypto-related transactions and deeming them illegal. Crypto economist and attorney Jamar Montgomery thinks it’s because “open source cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are a threat to a government’s control over a monetary and financial system.”While these governments desperately cling to the little financial control they have left — the rest of the world seems to be moving toward a new age. With even the infamous Los Angeles Staples Arena being renamed and rebranded to reflect a new moniker, “crypto.com,” it is certainly reflective of the new age of cryptocurrency.Wen-Kuni Ceant, theGrio.comWen-kuni Ceant is the CEO and Co-Founder of Politicking.

Grayscale estimated that revenue from virtual gaming worlds could grow to $400 billion in 2025, from around $180 billion in 2020.Yet Grayscale, which runs the world's biggest cryptocurrency fund, said the metaverse is still ""in its early innings."" It said Facebook's plans to spend $10 billion this year on the metaverse is a sign of the potential of the market.""The market opportunity for bringing the Metaverse to life may be worth over $1 trillion in annual revenue,"" the report said, although it did not specify a timeframe.The report's authors, Grayscale's head of research David Grider and research analyst Matt Maximo, argued the metaverse is a huge opportunity for crypto companies.Story continuesRead more: The metaverse won't revolutionize the office. But it might create new ways of earning money.Many current metaverse projects, such as virtual realities or games, are run by so-called Web2 companies, which are centralized and operate for profit. Facebook, which has launched the virtual reality space Horizon Worlds, is an example.But increasingly, metaverse projects are created on or are heavily tied to crypto technology, which can give users more control and allow them to earn money that they can use in the real world. This is known as the Web3 metaverse.Grayscale listed the opportunities for monetization of consumers within the Web3 metaverse. These include art galleries launching NFTs, games and casinos where players win crypto, digital advertising billboards, and music venues where DJs and artists hold concerts.In the third quarter, total Web3 and NFT fundraising hit $1.8 billion, out of overall crypto fundraising of $8.2 billion, Grayscale said. It added that investment has ""recently started to accelerate.""Grayscale's report focused on Decentraland. In that metaverse, people log in to play games, earn the native cryptocurrency mana, purchase NFTs including virtual land and collectibles, and vote on the governance of the economy.The crypto investment company recently created a Decentraland trust that invests solely in mana.

Bitcoin is being heralded as an inflation hedge on a par with gold and ether is rapidly becoming the cryptocurrency of choice for decentralized finance, play-to-earn games, digital collectors' items, known as non-fungible tokens, and likely soon, the metaverse.But it's not either of these two cryptocurrencies that have captured the public's imagination.Dogecoin, which was founded by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmers in 2013 as a joke, has been the most searched-for cryptocurrency in the largest number of states so far this year, according to research by The Advisor Coach, a financial advisor. The coin, which is based on an internet meme of a Japanese Shiba Inu dog, was the most-googled in 23 states, including Florida, Illinois and Michigan.This year, it shot to prominence, thanks in large part to the Twitter-based cheerleading of Tesla chief executive Elon Musk, who is a known crypto enthusiast that holds dogecoin, bitcoin and ether. Musk even went so far as saying in May this year that he might accept dogecoin as payment for his company's electric vehicles.By that point, dogecoin was already beloved among the army of Reddit retail traders, who had pushed the coin up to around $0.07, from closer to $0.007 at the start of the year and Musk's payment remark sent the price to a record $0.70. It's since eased to around $0.24, but it's still one of the crypto stars of 2021, with a gain of nearly 5,000% so far.Story continues""The rise in interest can be partially attributed to the endorsement of Elon Musk who stated earlier in the year that Tesla would accept dogecoin as a form of payment,"" The Advisor Coach note said.Crypto traders' adoration of Musk extends well beyond what coins he holds and has given rise to dogecoin spinoffs. The Tesla boss even owns a Shiba Inu. There's now a shiba inu coin, and even a floki inu, named after Musk's real-life pup, Floki.By contrast, bitcoin, the biggest and original cryptocurrency, was the most-searched for in just 10 states, including Connecticut, Alaska and Mississippi, ranking it second in the list. Bitcoin has led the surge in appetite for and adoption of cryptocurrencies. The total market value of crypto assets is hovering at close to $3 trillion, having risen from around $500 billion a year earlier, according to CoinGecko.Ether came in third place, being the most searched in eight states, while shiba inu landed in fourth place.

So-called whale transaction counts, or the number of SHIB transactions valued more than $100,000, have been rising since the beginning of November. Active deposits, or the amount of daily unique addresses to deposit SHIB to centralized exchanges, have also been increasing.Large valued SHIB transactions vs. SHIB's price. (Santiment)A spike in the active deposit metric may indicate a rise in short-term sell pressure for the token, according to Santiment’s metric explainer.“Like any asset, SHIB price is the product of supply and demand ... a larger percentage of SHIB buyers were evidently attracted by its speculative appeal alone,” Rick Delaney, a senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. “Drawn by the asset’s rising price, many SHIB investors simply do not have the long-term conviction needed to hold their positions or to reenter the market while the price is dropping.”Falling trading volumeWhile SHIB was once the most traded token on centralized exchanges, its trading volume has dropped significantly, as CoinGecko’s data shows.Story continuesNansen said that trading volume is among the most important metrics for SHIB and other meme tokens because a drop in trading volume shows that investors start to lose interest and become more “cautious” of putting money in the meme-themed tokens.The most traded alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on centralized exchanges now are gaming-related tokens, including decentraland (MANA) and the sandbox (SAND), according to CoinGecko.“SHIB’s price fall can be mostly attributed to the recent shift in investors’ interest from meme tokens to metaverse projects,” crypto price-tracking site CoinMarketCap wrote in a response to CoinDesk. “That can easily be seen by comparing the trading volume of MANA, SAND and SHIB.“Trading volume is always related to investors’ interest in a project,” it added.Social media buzz around the canine-themed coin has also sunk dramatically. At the time of publication, Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge retail interest in trending topics, showed a value of 22 for the search query “SHIB” globally, down from a peak at 100 at the end of October.A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time. A value of 22 means fewer people are scanning the web for information on SHIB.Silver liningDespite declining social media buzz around the meme token, retail investors’ interest in SHIB remains strong as the number of unique addresses holding SHIB continues to increase – good news for the SHIBArmy.The number of unique addresses holding SHIB surpassed one million on Nov. 11 – a time when SHIB’s prices were already dropping, according to Nansen data.“Retail interest is definitely there still, as people take speculative bets,” Daniel Khoo, research analyst at Nansen, said. “[No one] wants to miss out on getting rich.”","November 24, 2021, 11:19 AM"

Acala is a leader in the Polkadot ecosystem, and the SubQuery team will work with them to deploy the first version of the SubQuery Network as a smart contract in Acala’s EVM+.The launch of the SubQuery Network is designed to decentralize Polkadot’s leading data indexing services. Sam Zou, the Founder and CEO of SubQuery, stated that “We have ambitious growth plans, but our home will always be Polkadot. By partnering with Acala, the best DeFi platform on Polkadot, we have absolute confidence in their ability to help us not only in our token launch but also in future areas such as micropayments for indexers across networks.”SubQuery is a decentralized data aggregation, indexing & querying layer between Layer-1 blockchains and decentralized applications. According to the team, the SubQuery Network will decentralize and tokenize the ecosystem, making it possible for everyone to participate in the web 3.0 data revolution.In addition to the SubQuery Network, the team will launch the SQT token on the Acala parachain. According to the SubQuery team, the SQT token will be the first external token launched on the Acala parachain.Polkadot is Leading the DeFi GrowthPolkadot has become one of the most important blockchains within the DeFi ecosystem. The blockchain is gaining massive adoption from developers as the decentralized finance space continues to grow.Last week, Acala won Polkadot’s first parachain auction after accumulating 32 million DOT tokens from more than 81,000 community members.Story continuesThis content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it. Bette Chen, the Co-Founder of Acala, commented that “Acala will play the role of DeFi hub for Polkadot and a landing pad that aggregates assets and liquidity from a variety of blockchains.

Developers find it hard to provide basic privacy features to their users without breaking the bank.However, the DeFi ecosystem is growing, and new solutions are emerging to boost adoption for both the developers and the users.Panther Protocol Raises More Than $32 MillionPanther Protocol, an end-to-end privacy solution that creates privacy for DeFi and Web3 users across public blockchains, has announced that it has raised $22 million in a public sale event. Thus, bringing the total amount raised by the team to $32 million.According to its official website, Panther Protocol is an end-to-end privacy protocol for DeFi. Panther provides DeFi users with fully collateralized privacy-enhancing digital assets, leveraging crypto-economic incentives and zkSNARK technology.The Panther team said the funds would be used to build an interoperable privacy layer for the decentralized finance space and web 3.0. Panther Protocol’s CEO Oliver Gale told FXEmpire that “The raise was a humbling moment for us all. Our team executed the public sale flawlessly and barely took a breath to issue quiet congratulations before continuing with business as usual and preparation for our token generation event. This year will see a groundbreaking privacy innovation for launching protocols privately, and in a decentralized fashion, an incentivized testnet followed by a v1 protocol release taking us in the holidays.”By raising funds via a public sale, Panther Protocol is offering the opportunity for wider community engagement and participation in an end-to-end privacy protocol for DeFi and Web 3.0 users.At the moment, the Panther team is building on numerous blockchains, including Ethereum, Polygon, Flare, Songbird, NEAR, and Elrond. In addition to developing APIs, SDKs and custom integrations, Panther will enable decentralized application developers to provide privacy features within their apps. Hence, eliminating the need for highly specialized cryptographers and privacy tech engineers.Story continuesThe DeFi Ecosystem Continues to GrowThe DeFi space remains one of the fastest-growing in the cryptocurrency industry. Recent reports have indicated that the total value locked (TVL) across DeFi lending protocols surpassed the $230 billion mark earlier this year.The space is expected to grow even bigger over the coming years, and Panther Protocol wants to play an important part in the sector. Panther Protocol co-founder Anish Mohammed concluded that “As with duality of light, privacy has a dual nature, we are in the history of privacy where we are just reconciling, privacy’s dual nature. Panther protocol has managed to allow both privacy and authenticity by combining zero-knowledge proof systems and selective disclosures.”This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:Is Dogecoin Ready For A Short Squeeze?WTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+Tesla Shares Rally Despite Musk Selling Over $1 Billion of His StakeAUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis – Taking Out .7170 Could Trigger Acceleration into .7106SAND Soars Over 260% In November While Metaverse is on FireEUR/USD Mid-Session Technical Analysis for November 25, 2021","November 25, 2021, 7:37 AM"

The company also announced that it would be delisting Tron’s TRX.“The regulatory landscape for crypto is evolving rapidly… As a result, we will be limiting the ability for US users to open new positions in, or earn staking rewards for, ADA and TRX” a spokesperson from eToro told Business Insider.The surprise delisting triggered selling in ADA. The cryptocurrency now trades more than 5% down on the week, with its market cap having tumbled from above $61B at the start of the week to under $58B as of Thursday.As of the 26th of December 2021, eToro US users will no longer be able to buy the cryptocurrency. Then, after the 31st of December 2021, users holding ADA will no longer be able to earn staking rewards.In a video response to the decision, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano’s founder, blamed the decision on a lack of regulatory clarity and played down the impact the delisting would have on ADA’s price in the long term.He explained that European-based exchanges like eToro tend to limit their US exposure, given that US exposure comes with high regulatory costs. US-based exchanges like Coinbase, which are already paying for US regulatory compliance, have an easier in the US, he added.About Cardano and its Cryptocurrency ADACardano is an open-source, decentralised blockchain platform that achieves consensus using proof-of-stake and can facilitate internal transactions using its cryptocurrency ADA.It was founded in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, one of Ethereum’s co-founders, and was initially funded through an initial coin offering (ICO). In 2017, Cardano launched its crypto-currency ADA.Story continuesADA is the largest cryptocurrency (by market capitalisation) to use a proof-of-stake blockchain. Proponents of proof-of-stake blockchains argue that it is significantly more environmentally friendly than proof-of-work alternatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.Back in February, Hoskinson estimated that the Cardano network used just 0.01% of the energy used by the Bitcoin network.ADA Back Sharply from September’s Record HighsADA surpassed $3.0 in September, taking its gains on the year at the time to more than 1700%. Since the all-time highs printed two months ago, however, the cryptocurrency has seen a sharp correction.As of Thursday, with ADA trading in the mid-$1.700s, the cryptocurrency is down more than 40% from its prior record highs. But the cryptocurrency still trades with on-the-year gains of more than 800%.As regulatory concerns build and the broader crypto market continues to struggle, further profit-taking may see ADA drop back towards the next key area of support in the $1.0 area, which would amount to a further 40% correction.But between April and July this year, the $1.0 area proved to be a profitable area for short-term buyers on four different occasions. There is every chance this buy-the-dip mentality could return.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Trying to RecoverWTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+USD/JPY Price Forecast – US Dollar Continues to Press Ever so HigherTesla Shares Rally Despite Musk Selling Over $1 Billion of His StakeAUD/USD Forex Technical Analysis – Taking Out .7170 Could Trigger Acceleration into .7106Natural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Quiet During Holiday Trading","November 25, 2021, 5:50 AM"

The exchange told Insider the rapidly shifting regulatory landscape was behind its decision to limit the ability of US customers to open new positions in the two digital currencies.Many critics have argued that the regulatory landscape in the US for crypto is not clear yet but officials do believe that regulation is necessary and more policies are set to be put in place by 2022.Hoskinson, who founded cardano in 2015, said that he still needed further clarification on the trading platform's decision to delist ada for US customers.""There's currently nothing we've received, no regulatory event, no subpoena, nothing from any regulatory agency, no threats of lawsuits, none of these things, that's why we're so blindsided by it, because actually, the trend has been over the last six months a significant increase of liquidity on cardano,"" Hoskinson said.""On our side, we had no indication of this from eToro and it's rather unfortunate that nothing was sent our way,"" he said.The decision knocked almost 4.8% off the value of the ada token and sent it to three-month lows, while trx fell 5% to a one-month low on Wednesday,Story continuesBut ada has still been one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies of 2021. It's gained around 850% so far this year, which has made it the world's sixth largest digital token by market value, according to Coinmarketcap. It's fallen short of the 14,000% gain in rival solana's sol token this year, but has roundly beaten bitcoin's 102% rally.It's a smaller competitor to the ethereum network, thanks to its capability of hosting smart contracts and other applications that are key to decentralized finance.Cardano's ada has been listed by some of the biggest exchanges. It was listed on Coinbase on March 19 this year and on Binance in 2017, and Kraken listed it in 2018. Bitstamp decided to list ada last Thursday. The altcoin is not listed on Gemini yet.""We at least could have better understood the reasons and we'll of course reach out on our side to better understand reasons but it's primarily the foundation's responsibility,"" Hoskinson said, referring to the Cardano Foundation, a non-profit organization in Switzerland that is the custodian of the Cardano brand.While eToro's decision came as a surprise, Hoskinson was ultimately sanguine.It doesn't surprise me from the perspective of these things happen. Everybody has a different compliance desk. Everybody has a different regulatory tolerance. Everybody has a different customer base,"" he said.Read the original article on Business Insider","November 25, 2021, 8:02 AM"
331,331.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shib-slumps-large-holders-profits-191933336.html,SHIB Slumps as Large Holders Take Profits,"Shiba inu, the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, may still have its passionate following but it was in the red again Wednesday, following three consecutive weeks of losses.The loss followed profit-taking by large SHIB token holders, as the crypto market moved to a risk-off mode, a situation when traders reduce their exposure to riskier assets, according to blockchain data.“Crypto markets are currently in a risk-off mode following the new highs made by bitcoin and ether [about] two weeks back,” blockchain analytics firm Nansen said in a written response to CoinDesk, adding that it’s “natural to see higher beta assets like SHIB to dip in price as investors de-risk.”At press time, SHIB was trading at $0.0000370, down 11.89% in the past 24 hours, according to Messari.According to Nansen, an increasing number of wallets with significant holdings have been reducing their SHIB positions recently, possibly due to profit-taking.Data from blockchain data firm Santiment shows similar trends. So-called whale transaction counts, or the number of SHIB transactions valued more than $100,000, have been rising since the beginning of November. Active deposits, or the amount of daily unique addresses to deposit SHIB to centralized exchanges, have also been increasing.Large valued SHIB transactions vs. SHIB's price. (Santiment)A spike in the active deposit metric may indicate a rise in short-term sell pressure for the token, according to Santiment’s metric explainer.“Like any asset, SHIB price is the product of supply and demand ... a larger percentage of SHIB buyers were evidently attracted by its speculative appeal alone,” Rick Delaney, a senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. “Drawn by the asset’s rising price, many SHIB investors simply do not have the long-term conviction needed to hold their positions or to reenter the market while the price is dropping.”Falling trading volumeWhile SHIB was once the most traded token on centralized exchanges, its trading volume has dropped significantly, as CoinGecko’s data shows.Story continuesNansen said that trading volume is among the most important metrics for SHIB and other meme tokens because a drop in trading volume shows that investors start to lose interest and become more “cautious” of putting money in the meme-themed tokens.The most traded alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) on centralized exchanges now are gaming-related tokens, including decentraland (MANA) and the sandbox (SAND), according to CoinGecko.“SHIB’s price fall can be mostly attributed to the recent shift in investors’ interest from meme tokens to metaverse projects,” crypto price-tracking site CoinMarketCap wrote in a response to CoinDesk. “That can easily be seen by comparing the trading volume of MANA, SAND and SHIB.“Trading volume is always related to investors’ interest in a project,” it added.Social media buzz around the canine-themed coin has also sunk dramatically. At the time of publication, Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge retail interest in trending topics, showed a value of 22 for the search query “SHIB” globally, down from a peak at 100 at the end of October.A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time. A value of 22 means fewer people are scanning the web for information on SHIB.Silver liningDespite declining social media buzz around the meme token, retail investors’ interest in SHIB remains strong as the number of unique addresses holding SHIB continues to increase – good news for the SHIBArmy.The number of unique addresses holding SHIB surpassed one million on Nov. 11 – a time when SHIB’s prices were already dropping, according to Nansen data.“Retail interest is definitely there still, as people take speculative bets,” Daniel Khoo, research analyst at Nansen, said. “[No one] wants to miss out on getting rich.”","November 24, 2021, 11:19 AM"

It is up almost 40% in the past seven days.The token of the decentralized virtual reality platform built on the Ethereum blockchain now has a reported market capitalization of $9.2 billion, according to data provider Messari. The surge pushes it ahead of metaverse related play-to-earn game Axie Infinity’s AXS, which has a reported market cap of $8.6 billion.Tokens tied to the so-called metaverse, or shared virtual environments, have surged since October, when Facebook said it was changing its corporate name to Meta to signal an increasing focus on the sector. At the time, Decentraland’s market cap was just over $2 billion.“Investors are still wanting to capitalize on the narrative of the metaverse since the rebranding of Facebook,” said Juan Pellicer, an analyst at IntoTheBlock.Pellicer said that the recent waves of transactions for MANA of over $100,000, could be signalling institutional demand.He also noted that the recent virtual real estate plot sales are putting Decentraland in the spotlight again, which could also be helping propel the price.Reuters reported on Monday that a Tokens.com subsidiary, the Metaverse Group, bought a patch of virtual real estate in the Decentraland metaverse for 618,000 MANA – equivalent to around $3.2 million at the time of writing.Other gaming and metaverse related tokens are also trading upwards. On Monday, Sandbox’s SAND reached record highs after Adidas teased a partnership between the two companies.Axie Infinity’s AXS is up 15% in the last 7 days trading to around $140 per token.“Gaming is still very much at the forefront heading into Sandbox’s alpha release on November 29,” said Denis Vinokourov, an independent crypto analyst.Sandbox, which is owned by Hong Kong based game software company, Animoca Brands, announced this week that it will open up part of its metaverse via its multi-week play-to-earn Alpha event on Nov. 29.

336,336.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-gift-keeps-giving-charity-175034763.html,Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity),"Manuel Gonzalez Alzuru, a co-founder of a soon-to-launch non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace, says he is “doin’ good,” with a smile and a nod over a video call. “It never gets old saying that.” His platform, boyishly named DoinGud, is what Alzuru calls a “prosocial” experiment – a way to funnel some of the massive profits generated by the emergent NFT economy to worthy causes.“Ethereum gave me freedom,” Alzuru, 31, said. “And I’m always looking for ways to give back and to get some freedom for others as well.” That’s a message he thinks others in crypto could get behind. DoinGud, set to launch on Nov. 30, distinguishes itself from the increasingly crowded field of NFT markets by automatically directly a percentage (5%-95%) of sales to charities.This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.For an industry that prides itself on working on behalf of the “public good,” outright philanthropy isn’t often prioritized. Companies, projects and individuals have made breathtaking profits this year during a bull market that has driven the entire market cap of all cryptos, at times, above $3 trillion. It’s money that’s sometimes literally printed from nowhere and might be put to good use.“In order for you to give, you need to have something to give,” Alzuru said. NFTs have unlocked untold fortunes for a number of artists across industries – seemingly regardless of experience or, at times, talent. The “creator economy” was well underway in 2018 when the ERC-721 white paper was published, describing the smart contract standard underpinning NFTs. Since then, however, NFTs have extended the playing field of who can get paid for their work online.That’s at least part of what Alzuru means when he says “freedom:” Crypto has given him more than just financial “independence” (though there is that): It hast also granted him the lowercase-l, liberal freedoms some people in North America or Europe may take for granted. Born in Venezuela, Alzuru said he felt he had no guaranteed right to speech or expression, until he found Ethereum.Story continues“I’m able now to express myself on Ethereum, on the internet, and it stays there,” he said. “No one can take that away from me.” That’s the power of property rights enforced by code, he said. But don’t confuse him with any old capitalist; Alzuru, perhaps like Ethereum itself, is ideologically fluid.“I also believe in communal property rights, ‘public goods’ or public infrastructure,” he said, invoking the idea that crypto, open and accessible to all in theory, is a new type of digital commons. That’s ultimately what he wants DoinGud to become, to exist at the protocol level, a tool that other NFT or DeFi platforms can integrate to automate charitable giving.But public goods are open to exploitation. Or, as street artist Rich Simmons put it in an email, “The whole NFT and crypto climates so far have felt like a bit of a cash grab.” Simmons is joining the ranks (including publications like CoinDesk and The New Yorker) of those using NFTs to fund charitable giving. He’s using a platform called HistoryMakr and donating to several mental health organizations.Give crypto to get backIs crypto charity a way to cover up some of the evils of the industry? Under fire for its environmental footprint, rampant scams and general social toxicity, crypto certainly needs a little goodwill.See also: Want Cleaner Bitcoin Mining? Subsidize ItBut “corporate social responsibility,” the idea that traditional businesses owe something to the world in addition to their shareholders, often leads to less-than-desirable and sometimes hysterical results. It’s the same mentality that has the Central Intelligence Agency whitewashing itself as a progressive wing of government.At launch, creators on DoinGud will be able to determine which causes to support and what percentage is handed over. The intention is to open source its code and form a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to set protocols around charitable giving. “Consensus is also always changing,” Alzuru said, and six-member founding team isn’t comfortable determining what is “right or wrong.” A “curated” registry, launched in collaboration with The Giving Block, an established project that enables charities to accept crypto, may eventually blacklist unsavory recipients.Regardless of people’s motivations for giving, there’s a huge opportunity for charitable efforts to thrive in crypto. Blockchain has long been touted as a way to bring transparency to an industry that sometimes operates in the dark. Smart contracts, like the ones DoinGud designed, can make giving a routine part of doing business. Not to mention the wealth, the insane wealth, created during bull markets.Alzuru even thinks the psychological effects that transparent blockchains foster, the same mental forces that drive people to display NFTs as avatars on social media, could benefit charity. “With crypto, you have this proof that you’ve given back to the community,” Alzuru said, referring to the paper trail left on Ethereum. “Most of the time, [when giving], people are showing us vanity.”“You might want to create something for the betterment of humanity,” he said. “What you need to first think about yourself, like if you’re not good, if you’re not doing good yourself, you cannot be creating stuff for others.”","November 25, 2021, 9:50 AM"

339,339.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-5-high-growth-231700135.html,Goldman Sachs: Use these 5 high growth stocks to shield yourself from rising interest rates,"Goldman Sachs: Use these 5 high growth stocks to shield yourself from rising interest ratesRising interest rates are typically a threat to the stock market, but not all stocks are created equal.According to investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, one type of stock should continue to perform well as rates rise: highly profitable growth stocks.“Growth stocks with high profit margins outperformed unprofitable growth stocks when real rates jumped in 1Q 2021,” writes the bank’s chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, in a letter to investors. “Profitable stocks should remain resilient if rates rise in 2022.”Time may be short. High inflation is driving fears that the Fed could pull the trigger on higher rates soon. Already, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has gone from 0.93% in January to 1.64% today.Here are five high-growth, high-profit-margin stocks Goldman has found to brace your portfolio. At least one could be a lucrative pickup, especially if you’re investing for free.Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA)PHOTOCREO Michal Bednarek / ShutterstockMarathon is a cryptocurrency miner. Year-to-date, its mining fleet has produced approximately 2,516 self-mined bitcoins.And while some bitcoin miners might be tempted to sell their coins in the recent crypto rally, Marathon simply hoards them — an act known as “holding on for dear life,” or HODL, to crypto enthusiasts.Unsurprisingly, the stock did well in the crypto boom. Year-to-date, Marathon shares are up an incredible 362%.The stock came up in Goldman’s screening process because the consensus estimate for its annual revenue growth is 105% from 2021 to 2023. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for its 2023 profit margin is 51%.Riot Blockchain (RIOT)Morrowind / ShutterstockRiot Blockchain is another crypto play that showed up in Goldman’s search. It mines bitcoin and hosts mining equipment for institutional clients.In Q3, revenue totaled $64.8 million, up a staggering 2,532% year-over-year.But Wall Street believes the best is yet to come. The consensus annual revenue growth projection is 69% from now till 2023, with the profit margin reaching 46%.Story continuesShares have already more than doubled in 2021.Of course, there are many ways to jump into the crypto boom. For instance, some apps allow you to pick up crypto ETFs or buy cryptocurrency directly, all commission-free.Marvell Technology (MRVL)Raimond Spekking/Wikimedia CommonsChipmakers are firing on all cylinders right now, and Marvell Technology in particular is receiving plenty of investor attention.Its stock has surged 57% year-to-date.Thanks to growing demand from data centers — Marvell’s largest end market — the company’s revenue grew 48% year-over-year to $1.076 billion in its most recent fiscal quarter.Going forward, Wall Street expects the company’s sales to grow at an annual clip of 20% in the next two years, with a profit margin estimated at 35%.MP Materials (MP)RobSt / ShutterstockMP Materials is a rare earth mining company that billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya helped take public through a SPAC last year.The company owns and operates Mountain Pass, the only integrated rare earth mining and processing site in North America.Shares are up 49% year-to-date.One of the reasons behind the investor enthusiasm is that electric vehicles (EVs) need powerful rare earth magnets to turn energy into motion. Given the growth rate in the EV industry, MP’s outperformance shouldn’t come as a surprise.The company is expected to deliver annual revenue growth of 50% through 2023.Mastercard (MA)garmoncheg / ShutterstockIn terms of market cap, Mastercard is bigger than all the previously mentioned companies combined.While smaller companies tend to be more nimble, the financial services giant can also deliver rapid growth, especially as pandemic restrictions are being lifted.In Q3, Mastercard’s gross dollar volume rose 20% year-over-year on a local currency basis. Cross-border volume, on the other hand, surged a more impressive 52%.Analysts expect the company’s revenue to increase at an annual clip of 18% in the next two years.Yes, Mastercard does trade at over $330 per share at the moment. But you can still get a piece of the company using a popular app that allows you to buy fractions of shares with as much money as you are willing to spend.A fine strategy further afieldSeventyFour / ShutterstockOf course, you don’t have to limit yourself to the stock market.There are real assets that have survived all kinds of interest-rate environments while also delivering market-beating returns.For instance, contemporary artwork has outperformed the S&P 500 by a commanding 174% over the past 25 years, according to the Citi Global Art Market chart.Investing in fine art by the likes of Banksy and Andy Warhol used to be an option only for the ultra rich. But with a new investing platform, you can invest in iconic artworks, too, just like Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates do.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

WhaleAlert has recently reported a purchase of over 850 billion Shiba Inu coins, but this move also failed to provide material support to Shiba Inu.It looks that the interest in the coin is fading which is natural since Shiba Inu has been moving lower since late October, when it reached all-time high levels near $0.000090. Shiba Inu has already lost more than half of its value in less than one month, so traders’ interest in the coin is declining.Crypto markets are very dependent on momentum. According to CoinMarketCap, almost 15,000 cryptocurrencies exist in the world. While most cryptocurrencies are not available on major exchanges, traders still have plenty of options to choose from so they tend to move from one coin to another depending on the near-term trends.Not surprisingly, recent data from Google suggests that search interest in Shiba Inu coin is declining. Trends change quickly in the crypto world, and only the leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, managed to stay at the top of traders’ wishlists. The interest in other cryptocurrencies is often volatile, and they quickly move back and forth in rankings.At this point, it is obvious that Shiba Inu needs additional upside catalysts to break the current downside trend. Whale transactions failed to provide enough support to the cryptocurrency, and it needs to get back on the “hype train” to attract more traders.Technical AnalysisShiba Inu has recently made an attempt to settle above the resistance at the 50 EMA at $0.004245 but failed to develop sufficient upside momentum and moved back below the $0.000040 level. Currently, Shiba Inu is trying to settle below this level.Story continuesRSI remains in the moderate territory as Shiba Inu moves lower without huge sell-offs, so there is plenty of room to gain additional downside momentum in case the right catalysts emerge.In case Shiba Inu manages to settle below the $0.000040 level, it will move towards the next support level which is located at the recent lows near $0.000036.A move below $0.000036 will push Shiba Inu towards the support at $0.000033, although it can also get some support near the $0.000035 level. If Shiba Inu declines below $0.000033, it will move towards the support at $0.000032.On the upside, a move above $0.000040 will push Shiba Inu towards the resistance at the 50 EMA. In case Shiba Inu manages to settle above the 50 EMA, it will head towards the next resistance level at $0.00004450. A successful test of this level will open the way to the test of the resistance at the 20 EMA near $0.000047.For a look at all of today’s economic events, check out our economic calendar.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:EUR/USD Price Forecast – Euro Trying to RecoverGBP/USD Price Forecast – British Pound Continues to Look SickShiba Inu Keeps Moving Lower As Whale Transactions Fail To Provide Enough SupportBitcoin Price Prediction – Avoiding sub-$57,000 Would Bring $60,000 into PlaySAND Soars Over 260% In November While Metaverse is on FireStripe is Open to Accepting Crypto Payments Again","November 25, 2021, 1:20 AM"

At the time, the price per coin reached an all-time high of just over $0.00008. That marked a near 2000% gain from the start of the month when the cryptocurrency’s price per coin was under $0.00001 and its market cap under $3.0B.The surge in Shiba Inu valuation went hand in hand with a rapid rise in retail interest in the coin. According to google trends, overall search interest in the term “Shiba Inu” surged by more than 30 times between the end of September and 27th of October. Similarly, over the same time period, Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric rose from under 20K to above 500K.Retail interest fadesBut as indicators of retail trader interest in the meme coin have faded in the subsequent weeks, SHIB’s price has gradually pulled back. According to google trends data, by the 23rd of November, overall search interest in “Shiba Inu” has dropped more than by 10 times compared to the record high on the 27th of October. Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric also pulled back to under 70K by the 23rd of November.Meanwhile, over the same time period, SHIB has come under pressure. The coin is now down over 50% from the late October record highs and trades just above $0.0004. That means its market cap has dropped to around $24B, according to TradingView.This is not the first time we have seen SHIB rise and fall in tandem with a rise and fall in retail investor interest in the meme coin. Recall back to May, when SHIB jumped from under $0.000002 to near $0.000035, a more than 20 fold increase in value, in a matter of days, before then sharply dipping back under $0.00001 (where it then stayed until October). That spike in valuation also coincided with a sharp uptick in search interest, according to google trends.What next for SHIB?Clearly then, if SHIB is to regain its mojo and head back to record levels, the retail trading/investing community is going to have to start getting excited about it again. Here the signs are tentatively promising. On Thursday the 25th of November, Lunarcrush’s Social Volume metric lept back above 100K from close to 60K the day before. Similarly, in the last five days, their Social Engagement metric has risen from under 60K (a near-one-month low) to above 120K, a more than three-week high.Story continuesSHIB might be showing early signs of responding to this uptick in interest. The coin rose more than 20% in value on Thursday the 25th of November and is threatening a technical break above a downtrend that has suppressed the price action for the whole of November.Should SHIB break to the north of this level and should an acceleration in the coins gains rekindle retail trader/social media excitement about the coin, SHIB could be looking at some rapid gains back towards its prior record highs.This article was originally posted on FX EmpireMore From FXEMPIRE:S&P 500 Price Forecast – Futures Markets Quiet in Thin Holiday TradingNatural Gas Price Forecast – Natural Gas Markets Quiet During Holiday TradingGermany’s New Multi-party Government to Raise Investment but Maintain Fiscal DisciplineGold Price Forecast – Gold Markets Stable on ThanksgivingUSD/JPY Forex Technical Analysis – Convincing Breakout Over 115.615 Puts 118.601 – 118.658 on the RadarWTI Oil At Crossroads As Traders Wait For The Next Move From OPEC+","November 25, 2021, 10:31 AM"

Reversing a 0.72% loss from Wednesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $59,016.A mixed morning saw Bitcoin fall to a mid-morning intraday low $57,067 before making a move.Steering clear of the first major support level at $56,120, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $59,423.Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $57,987 and the second major resistance level at $58,808.A late pullback saw Bitcoin briefly fall back through the second major resistance level before wrapping up the day at $59,100 levels.The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the latest pullback to sub-$56,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $28,814 to form a near-term bearish trend.The Rest of the PackAcross the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Thursday.Crypto.com Coin tumbled by 15.93%, with Bitcoin Cash SV (-0.29%) and Polkadot (-0.09%) also seeing red on the dayIt was a bullish day for the rest of the majors, however.Binance Coin rallied by 8.15% to lead the way, with Ethereum (+5.97%) and Litecoin (+5.11%) close behind.Cardano’s ADA (+0.48%), Chainlink (+2.98%), and Ripple’s XRP (+1.00%) trailed the front runners, however.In the current week, the crypto total market fell to a Tuesday low $2,426bn before rising to a Thursday high $2,685bn.

The second major resistance level sits at $60,859.A fall through the $58,502 pivot would bring the first major support level at $57,581 into play.Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$56,000 levels.

The Fed's ideal annual rate of inflation is roughly 2 percent, but the bank recently adopted a strategy that called for allowing price and wage increases to run slightly higher to make up for more than a decade of sluggish growth. Even so, inflation has risen higher and stayed at elevated levels for much longer than Fed officials expected earlier this year.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who was renominated this week by President Biden, is among several bank officials who've warned against raising rates abruptly to halt inflation that is driven in large part by the pandemic. Yet a growing number of Fed officials have called for the bank to start pulling back on stimulus at a much faster pace.The Fed announced after the November meeting that it would reduce its monthly purchases of Treasury and mortgage bonds by up to $15 billion, but did not commit to raising rates sooner. Further increases in the inflation rate could prompt the Fed to accelerate its tapering of bond purchases, which began in March 2020 to keep financial markets flowing amid the onset of the pandemic.","November 24, 2021, 11:31 AM"

There is a “realistic possibility” for the Fed to start raising borrowing costs in May, followed by increases in July and November, they said.Fed Vice Chair Rich Clarida and San Francisco Fed Bank President Mary Daly both said in recent days that they are open to an quicker taper. Data released this week showed strong consumer spending, a tightening labor market and the fastest inflation in three decades.“The increased openness to accelerating the taper pace likely reflects both somewhat higher-than-expected inflation over the last two months and greater comfort among Fed officials that a faster pace would not shock financial markets,” Hatzius and colleagues wrote in their report.(Adds details of new forecast from second paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMedical Debt Is Crushing Black Americans, and Hospitals Aren’t HelpingWildfires Are Getting Worse, and One Chemical Company Is Reaping the BenefitsHow Child Care Became the Most Broken Business in America©2021 Bloomberg L.P.","November 25, 2021, 3:33 AM"

The cryptocurrency fell almost 7% on Friday amid a massive pullback in the financial markets as concerns over a new coronavirus variant damped risk appetite.Read more: Bitcoin Slips to $55K as Renewed Covid Concerns Jolt Traditional Markets","November 26, 2021, 3:06 AM"

Grayscale estimated that revenue from virtual gaming worlds could grow to $400 billion in 2025, from around $180 billion in 2020.Yet Grayscale, which runs the world's biggest cryptocurrency fund, said the metaverse is still ""in its early innings."" It said Facebook's plans to spend $10 billion this year on the metaverse is a sign of the potential of the market.""The market opportunity for bringing the Metaverse to life may be worth over $1 trillion in annual revenue,"" the report said, although it did not specify a timeframe.The report's authors, Grayscale's head of research David Grider and research analyst Matt Maximo, argued the metaverse is a huge opportunity for crypto companies.Story continuesRead more: The metaverse won't revolutionize the office. But it might create new ways of earning money.Many current metaverse projects, such as virtual realities or games, are run by so-called Web2 companies, which are centralized and operate for profit. Facebook, which has launched the virtual reality space Horizon Worlds, is an example.But increasingly, metaverse projects are created on or are heavily tied to crypto technology, which can give users more control and allow them to earn money that they can use in the real world. This is known as the Web3 metaverse.Grayscale listed the opportunities for monetization of consumers within the Web3 metaverse. These include art galleries launching NFTs, games and casinos where players win crypto, digital advertising billboards, and music venues where DJs and artists hold concerts.In the third quarter, total Web3 and NFT fundraising hit $1.8 billion, out of overall crypto fundraising of $8.2 billion, Grayscale said. It added that investment has ""recently started to accelerate.""Grayscale's report focused on Decentraland. In that metaverse, people log in to play games, earn the native cryptocurrency mana, purchase NFTs including virtual land and collectibles, and vote on the governance of the economy.The crypto investment company recently created a Decentraland trust that invests solely in mana.

359,359.0,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptocurrency-currency-future-142000578.html,Is cryptocurrency the currency of the future?,"For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberationIn this news cycle, cryptocurrency seems to be the only thing anyone is talking about. It seems society has suddenly propelled back to the future as we have seen nations start to adopt a phenomenon known to many as crypto — the world’s newest medium of exchange.The best way to describe crypto is as the digital currency it is, thinking of the many different types of cryptocurrency as currencies with different utilities. The one quality that they all share is that they contribute to the creation of a richer digital experience.The Bitcoin logo appears on the display screen of a cryptocurrency ATM at the Smoker’s Choice store in Salem, N.H. (AP Photo/Charles Krupa, File)The challenging part is understanding that cryptocurrency fluctuates rapidly and can be volatile — sparking the interest of investors and micro-investors throughout the world who are looking for ways to diversify their portfolios. Some experts believe cryptocurrency is all about timing and crypto-believers argue that cash and the USD is archaic and truly the inferior form of currency … but are these investors right?It is impossible to demystify the secret of cryptocurrency without answering the infamous question — what is blockchain? Often discussed in tandem, many mix up the idea of cryptocurrency with blockchain, and others simply don’t know the difference.Blockchain is a decentralized technology that is incredibly secure (think of the root of the word crypto — as in encryption). The benefit of blockchains is that its technology is spread across many different computer operating systems, thus arguably making them more secure than existing payment systems.Easily accessible crypto-wallets like Coinbase, Robinhood, and Gemini, have made it easy to buy and sell over 50 different cryptocurrencies. Gemini is particularly interesting because of its founders, Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who started the company in 2014.If you ever watched The Social Network, you will remember the Winklevoss Twins — the two brothers that infamously founded HarvardConnection, a social media network on Harvard’s campus that predated Facebook. Although the Winklevoss brothers seemed to have lost the Facebook war, they continue to prove themselves as formidable opponents to Mark Zuckerberg in the “Metaverse”— going on to found one of cryptocurrency’s leading exchanges.Story continuesHowever, while the Winklevoss brothers have used this and their other investments to propel them into the billionaire stratosphere along with their rival Zuckerberg — cryptocurrency has always had a different meaning for Black and Brown people.For many Black people — cryptocurrency has been seen as one of the tenants of true economic liberation. In this case, it comes as no surprise that Black people have been, by and large, leading the cryptocurrency boom. The University of Chicago’s National Opinion Research Center reports that 46% of cryptocurrency holders are people of color — with 18% of those holders being Black. These numbers make sense considering the deep seated distrust in the Black community surrounding government regulation and the wealth gap.The Bitcoin logo is displayed on the side of a Bitcoin ATM on November 10, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)To many, cryptocurrency will serve as the great equalizer that education was once viewed as in this country. Accessibility is another reason for cryptocurrency’s success within the Black community. Investors can purchase cryptocurrency at a painfully low entry point — you only need a dollar to buy crypto as you can fractionally invest in currencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum buying a minute fraction of the coin.This enables folks with less disposable income to get in on the fun whereas the stock market has traditionally excluded these population groups. But cryptocurrency has implications that span far larger than just Black America. Cryptocurrency has also become a force to be reckoned with on the forefront of the global community. This has left many economists asking the question of what crypto means for the global economy?Akon was perhaps one of the first celebrities to openly discuss cryptocurrency and its ramifications, as early as 2018, when he declared his own cryptocurrency, Akoin. Akon noted that this cryptocurrency would guide Africa into financial freedom and be the basis upon which his futuristic city would be built.If Akon’s plan does succeed, it would liberate the Senegalese people from the French-backed CFA (the national currency of Senegal and many Francophone countries in West Africa). But Senegal isn’t the only African country interested in cryptocurrency. Nigeria has quickly grown to be the second largest market for crypto trading, following the United States.Akon attends the Jingle Bell Ball at the O2 Arena on December 5, 2010 in London, England. (Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)Many Nigerians have found the use of cryptocurrency as a solvent way to protect their money against the depreciation of the Naira (which is linked to the USD.) Moreover, cryptocurrency simplifies the transference of remittances (money sent back home by nationals or family members who live internationally) and minimizes costs and fees. The issue of remittances is a phenomenon that can be seen throughout the African continent and across the pond in the Caribbean and Latin America as well.El Salvador has led the Latin American community in cryptocurrency, becoming the first country to accept Bitcoin as legal tender. Both President Nayib Bukele and Maria Luisa Hayem, El Salvador’s Minister of Economy, are proud to have led Latin America into this innovative economic revolution. Despite their efforts, adoption has been slow, with only 12% of consumers using cryptocurrency since the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender in September.Yet not all countries have bought into the hype, with China banning all crypto-related transactions and deeming them illegal. Crypto economist and attorney Jamar Montgomery thinks it’s because “open source cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are a threat to a government’s control over a monetary and financial system.”While these governments desperately cling to the little financial control they have left — the rest of the world seems to be moving toward a new age. With even the infamous Los Angeles Staples Arena being renamed and rebranded to reflect a new moniker, “crypto.com,” it is certainly reflective of the new age of cryptocurrency.Wen-Kuni Ceant, theGrio.comWen-kuni Ceant is the CEO and Co-Founder of Politicking.

It's down about 20% from its all-time high of roughly $69,000, which it hit earlier this month.Ethereum (ETH-USD), the world’s second biggest crypto by market cap, plummeted 6% and was trading at $4,051, even as US banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) said the crypto could be a better investment than bitcoin.Ethereum slumped on Friday morning. Chart: Yahoo Finance UK“The rise in bond yields and the eventual normalisation of monetary policy is putting downward pressure on bitcoin as a form of digital gold, the same way higher real yields have been putting downward pressure on traditional gold,” the JPMorgan report said.“With ethereum deriving its value from its applications, ranging from DeFi [decentralised finance] to gaming to NFTs [non-fungible tokens] and stablecoins, it appears less susceptible than bitcoin to higher real yields,” it added.Read more: Global stock markets crash as new COVID variant spooks investorsInvestors seem concerned about the new COVID-19 strain discovered in South Africa. The World Health Organization is keeping an eye on this new variant with many alterations to the spike protein, as COVID cases increase in the run up to the holiday season. The UK government said six African countries would be added to its travel 'red list', with flights being temporarily banned.Bitcoin was down on Friday morning.

Either way, it may have an impact, resulting in similar price fluctuations when China banned cryptos.”He said if India decides to steer clear of any ban and instead go for regulating the space, prices might pick up, but if this major emerging economy chooses to ban these volatile assets, prices may undergo a severe correction just like it happened at the time of China's crackdown.Watch: What are the risks of investing in cryptocurrency?","November 26, 2021, 3:14 AM"
